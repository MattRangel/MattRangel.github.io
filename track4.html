<p>During the song he say "Only for the night" I looked it up and to me I think it's this guy's fear of commitment. I don't really relate with that, but I can with the the aspect of not wanting to mess up what he has by moving forward. To do things like that it takes putting yourself in a emotionally vulnerable position. I don't know how vulnerable you felt telling how you felt, but I was bracing myself to not have my feeling reciprocated.</p>
