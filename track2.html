<p><i>"I can't believe I captured your heart"</i></p>
<p>I used to not really have the best self image of myself. That led to me only going for people I kind of liked, because I didn't think it was possible or allowed for me to do any better. That was a long time ago and now I have a higher more healthy view of myself. When I talk with you though it still seems surreal to me in a way sometimes though.</p>
