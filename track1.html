<p>Okay this song instantly made me think of you. It was actually kind of hard to save it for this playlist and not just text it to you when I heard it. Even though it's kind of unreasonable I still like to wonder what it would be like to just drop everything and leave to someplace with someone to peruse the things I really love doing.</p>
