<h1>Forget About Life - Alvvays</h1>
<p><i>"Do you want to forget about life, with me tonight?"</i></p>
<p>Sometimes I get that feeling of wanting to zone out of life for just a little while. I don't really ever have the opportunity, but spending time getting away from everything and doing unimportant things is something that would really appeal to me and would definitely be amplified by having another person around. And just stuff like driving to nowhere or walking aimlessly around outdoors with just each other's company.</p>
