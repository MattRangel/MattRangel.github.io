<p><i>"Be mine, I won't act shy"</i></p>
<p>I was delighted when I noticed us becoming more comfortable around each other. Whoever I'm with I definitely (I feel like I've been saying that word a ton bwahaha) want to be best friends with them. So first things first lets become good friend (worry about other stuff laaater), and that can't happen if we are still shy around each other lol.</p>
