<h1>It's Love - Chris Knox</h1>
<p><i>"I want you every single day"</i></p>
<p>Okay, this is a full on no doubt love song and I know we aren't in love right now, but it's still nice. I definitely enjoy the chats we've been having almost every single day. Even though we talk pretty often I still get this weird missing you feeling. Not like miss talking to you though, more like miss seeing you which is odd since I never have lol.</p>
