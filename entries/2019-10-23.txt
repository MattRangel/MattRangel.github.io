October 23, 2019!
For my birthday today my grandmother made Lasagna and my mom bought a cookie cake.
After eating and singing and taking photos we were just sitting in the living room I then got a call from my sister which was cool getting to talk with her.
After getting home from my grandparents’ house my mom and I watched a movie (Stripes 1981) and I ate popsicles and marshmellows￼.
I am actually going to bed earlier than I have been these last few days which is a little suprising considering all the things I did.
All in all I had a pretty good birthday!
