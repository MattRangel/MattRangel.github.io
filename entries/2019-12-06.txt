After school my dad met my brother and I at HEB to get some food for dinner plus snak food.
My dad made shrimp and potatoes.
After eating dinner I put on “Rambo: Last Blood” (2019) which was a pretty good movie.
I felt that the movie did not do the rambo series an injustice and had a good plot to it.
I’m also not going to bed at such a good time but I plan to try better tomorrow and not sleep horribly for the whole weekend.
