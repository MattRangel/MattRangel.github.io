Woke up later then I normally do on weekends because of how late I went to bed last night.
This afternoon my family all went to my parents’ friends house to eat dinner and chat.
We left there house pretty late and so I’m not going to probably get a lot of sleep tonight either.
The plan is to start going to bed at a good time starting tomorrow.
