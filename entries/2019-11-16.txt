For got to write this days entry so I’m writing it the bext morning.
There was a lot of driving today, my mom, brother, and I all drove to walmart to get some whipped cream for a￼￼ pie as well as some other things.
By the time we finished at walmart my brother had made plans to go hang out with his friend for the night, so we drove all the way over there to drop my brother off.
Getting home after dropping my brother off we realized￼ a mirror we bought got left at the store.
And so we both got back in the car and drove all the way back to walmart to get the mirror and some other things.
Once finally getting home for good my mom and I tried the pie that we had bought and we made some other food.
After all that I pulled up a movie and after finishing the movie it was well into the night, so I definitally did not have too lengthy of a sleep.
