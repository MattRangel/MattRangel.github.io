I went to church with my friend because his church was having a meal for his birthday after the service.
I liked going and getting to hang out with him, plus the food was good.
This is also like the third weekend in a row where I havenâ€™t just hung out at home all day.
I like having things to go out and do now, but it was nice not having anything to do yesterday.
