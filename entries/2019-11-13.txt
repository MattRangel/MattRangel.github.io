Welp, tonight was definitely￼ not a continuation￼ of my on time going to bed days.
I stayed up late this time because my mom, brother, and I were all watching a movie called American History X (was a very good movie).
I’ve also been trying new routes to get home from school faster and the one that I tried today was not faster at all and took a very long time which was not fun.
