I went to the dentist office this morning before school and had a little bit of decay which is going to be fixed next week. 
I was kind of annoyed that I got decay because I thought I’ve been doing pretty good teeth brushing.
But the decay was actually under a filling I later found out though. That meant it was out of my control to prevent and so that’s somewhat of a good twist, also that means my brushing is still A+.
Besides that not a whole bunch more happened.
