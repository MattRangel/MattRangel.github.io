Today was another lazy day of hanging out at home.
My jaw is still a little bit sore but it’s getting better quickly.
I also went to the quinceanera my brother was dancing at for a bit.
That also means that I no longer have to take him to the dance practices on tuesdays and thursdays which I’m happy about.
