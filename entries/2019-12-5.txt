October 5, 2019
On November 20th last month I decided that if I still wanted to shave my head myself by December 20th I would do it.
It’s about two weeks till then and that is still the plan.
I saw a friend of mine with a rubiks cube today and that got me back into rubiks cubes.
I’m also doing “okay” at my sleeping.
I’ve been going to bed about one hour after I’d like pretty consistently￼.
I’m for sure getting more sleep than what I was getting last week during my break though, and I can definitely￼ feel myself feeling better.
