Today after school my dad and I found a nail in the wheel of my car while looking for what was causing it to lose air.
My dad set an appointment for my to go to the mechanic tomorrow.
It’s giving me this small uneasiness though which feels weird, because I’ve got nothing to actually worry about and also because I don’t usually feel that way about a lot of things.
