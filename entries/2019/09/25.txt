An hour or two after I got home from school I went with my mom to this thing called “High Fitness” which is like a dance workout thing.
I am not too coordinated though so it was a little bit confusing at times but overall it was a fun (one time haha) thing.
I got home late though so that ends my streak of going to bed at a good time.
Combine that with the exercise I did and I forsee myself being very tired tomorrow morning.
