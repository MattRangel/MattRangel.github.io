I had no school today because it’s labor day, and so I didn’t really do a whole bunch today. 
I spent the afternoon at my grandparents house where I ate lunch and dinner that my grandmother made. 
Besides that not too much happened today, but that isn’t a bad thing. Nothing days are good to get peace and rest your mind.
