Driving home tonight my brother and I had an upset for the first time in a while.
I do have some new things in my head to pay attention to that I learned from that though, which is good.
Besides that I am going to bed at a very good time tonight compared to yesterday.
This is going to be the start to a long streak of going to bed on time. I can feel it! haha
