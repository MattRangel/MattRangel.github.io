Today I went to Mine Gala which was a music festival inside of Minecraft.
I’ve heard of the previous music festivals that got put on in minecraft before, but they were always at times when I could not join.
I had time to join this time though, and it was pretty fun.
I also discovered a couple new people who’s music I liked and plan to check out more later. (100 gecs and umru)
