This afternoon I had to drive my brother somewhere which I was mildly annoyed about at first.
Driving away from dropping him off though I realized that it’s been a really long time since  I drove just by myself.
I forgot that I actually enjoy driving around in the night with just myself.
So after that I didn’t really mind having to drive him anymore.
