Today I drove my brother and monther to the Roundrock outlet mall.
At the mall I bough a pair of yellow vans, a tool for my skateboard, and a pair of black jeans.
After I got home from the mall at around 6 or 7pm my brother asked me about and hour later to drive him to walmart so he cold get some limitied edition cereal.
I was happy to drive him because I enjoy drives in the night.
After getting home from walmart I watched the movie “Time Trap” (2018) which I rate around 6/10 the suspense was good and I liked the story.
