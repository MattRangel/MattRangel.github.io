On my way home from school today my brother accidentally hit my hand which shifted my car into neutral. 
Instead of putting my car back into drive, I shifted it into reverse by mistake. So I had to put my car to a full stop and then shift it back to drive in order to correct all that.
A long while ago my mom showed my what happens when you shift the car into neutral while driving. 
Itâ€™s funny to think that just that small thing so long ago helped me not panic as much today.
