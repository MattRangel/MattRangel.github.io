Driving in the car today I listend to blackbear who I’ve just started listening because a new friend of mine said they like him.
I was meaning to listen to “The Sons of Pioneers” because I’ve just found out today that the Ringo movie is based of the song Ringo that they cover which totally makes sense now that I think about it.
