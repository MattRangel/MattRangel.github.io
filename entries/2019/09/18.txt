Not a whole lot happened today, but I am still going to bed at a decent time.
I did find out today that I have to take my brother to his friend’s quinceanera twice a week and it wasn’t just a one time thing like I thought.
So now I have to drive him to this person’s house every Tuesday and Thursday all the way until November comes.
That will be a lot of alone driving time to sing or think about things though haha!
