Today after school a while after I got home I watched Melanie Martinez’s movie, K-12 (2019).
I rate her movie 8/10. I really like the idea of a movie based of a music album and I think she did a pretty good job at it.
I actually have not really listened to any of Melanie’s music before today, but after hearing some of it in the movie I decided I do like her music and I saved her songs to my phone.
