Went to a different church than I normally do because I was with my grandparents.
I liked the spanish one I went to today more I think bevause it was more upbeat and it felt like it went a little quicker.
I also got a day and time set for my date (or whatever I should call it lol) with V so thats coming up this saturday the day right after my concert to see Sigrid.
Lots of things to look foward to!
