I had today off from school for Columbus day so I went to my grandparents’ house early for breakfast.
Besides eating and watching netflix today I also found a website (https://b-ok.cc) that has a bunch of books on it for free. 
So I was able to download a few books I’ve been wanting to read.
I started “The Dude De Ching” which is basically a Dudeist/Modern version of the “Tao Te Ching” which I was already reading before this.
Now I’m getting two things done off my Matt list at the same time.
