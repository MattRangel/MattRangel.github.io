Today was a pretty average day.
I played hackysack after eating lunch today with my friends, even though it was sprinkling outside.
The puddles got the hackysack wet which makes it not as fun to use, because you’re avoiding gettong too dirty from the water it’s soaked it.
It was also very humid and not very cool outside, so I also got kind of hot amd sweaty playing outside.
Despite all that we still had some fun playing and even had someone we don’t know join us at the end of the lunch period for a moment.
