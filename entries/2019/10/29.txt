Today my friends and I played hacky sack indoors for the first time after eating lunch because it was too wet and rainy outside.
Iâ€™ve also started working on a little automation project of mine again that I had stopped working on for a while.
I got the motivation to start working on it again after having some ideas for it come to me.
