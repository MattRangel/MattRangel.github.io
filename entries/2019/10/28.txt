Nothing too crazily out of the ordinairy happend today.
I can tell I’m getting better at hacky sack though after practicing all weekend though.
I also listend to Tessa Violet’s new album “Bad Ideas” for the first time.
I’m pretty late to that part as it came out three days ago though.
But anyway my favorite song on the album right now is “Bored”.
