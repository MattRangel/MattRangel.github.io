The money for my yearly apple music subscription got automatically withdrawn this morning so I now don’t have much money.
I am also going to bed very late for the third night in a row.
That’s the opposite kind of sleeping streak I want.
What kept me up today is I put off cleaning my room and washing the dishes till later then I should have.
The plan is to go to bed at a decent time tomorrow so I’ll see how that goes.
