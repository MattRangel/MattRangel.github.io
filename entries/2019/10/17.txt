I played hackysack after lunch like i normally have been, but I also played the entire class period before lunch.
So all that jumping around made me very tired for the rest of the day.
Tonight I got my Sigrid sweatshirt which I really like (I just tried it on a few minutes ago).
I’m starting to really like these sweatshirts I’m buying so I foresee myself buying a lot more this winter.
