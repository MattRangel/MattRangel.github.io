After finishing eating lunch at school today my friends and I went to stand outside which weâ€™ve started doing lately.
I jokingly asked if they wanted to play hackysack, but they actually did want to so we ended up playing for the rest of the lunch period.
Walking back to class after lunch was over I found out that two of my friends that were playing had no idea that hackysack was a game.
That was very suprising to me that someone would not know that.
