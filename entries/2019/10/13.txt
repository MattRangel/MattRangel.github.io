My mom took my brother and I to a different church than we normaly go to just to see what itâ€™s about.
It was nice because it was only 5 minutes away from my house instead of 20 minutes like the one we normaly go to is.
After church we came back home and then like 5 or 6 hours later in the afternoon I drove my brother and I to meet up with my mom to eat at a buffet with her.
The one we wanted to go to was closed though so we ended up going to a chinese buffet where I ate a little too much food.
