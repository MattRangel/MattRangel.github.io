Still not going to bed at such a good time, but I’m not suprised because I’m on my thanksgiving break.
At my grandparent’s house besides eating today was a play on my computer day.
I also watched a little bit of youtube off my phone.
I stopped taking the antibiotic pills that I got from the doctor for my wisdom teeth operation recovery, because I kept forgetting to take them and also my parents figured I’ll probally be just fine without them anyway.
