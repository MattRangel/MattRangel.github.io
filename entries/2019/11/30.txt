This morning my familey and I went to go see two of our friends (Kristin and Audrey) at starbucks.
After getting home from that my dad made chinese food for lunch which was very good.
Following lunch I just chilled the rest of the afternoon.
Towards the night we all got in the car again and drove out to Dairy Queen to get ice cream which was good.
Getting home from that I stayed up late and now I’m going to bed at a time that doesn’t help me get ready for school too much.
