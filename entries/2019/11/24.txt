I don’t feel like I have much to write for today so this one will be short.
My parents, brother, grandparents, and I all went to our church’s 50th anniversary where we ate after the church part.
Played some cumbia music for my grandparents on the drive home which they liked.
After dropping my grabdparents off my dad and I went to go get ice cream.
Getting home after that I just watched movies and played on my computer for the rest of the afternoon.
I am also not going to bed at such a good time so I definitally want to fix that at some point.
