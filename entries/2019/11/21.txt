Forgot to write this one the night of.
Today I got all four of my wisdom teeth removed.
On the way to the place someone hit my momâ€™s car so we got there thirty minutes late.
Luckly they still let us go even though we were very late.
After the operation I was laughing very hard at everything because of the medicine they used to make me fall asleep.
Getting home from the opperation my brain was back to normal and I mainly just watched movies for the rest of the afternoon.
