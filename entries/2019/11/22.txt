I didnâ€™t go to school today because of my wisdom teeth removal I got yesterday.
So I played on my computer some and also watched movies.
One of the movies that I watched with my mom was Django Unchained (2012) which both my mom and I liked.
My jaw is still sore from my operation but it is no where near intolerable which I am very thankful for.
