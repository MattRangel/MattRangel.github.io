Today I watched the movie “This Is England” (2006) it was another pretty good movie.
I’ve been doing well at choosing movies that are not terrible lately.
I also thought more about shaving my head which included reading into S.H.A.R.P. which stands for “SkinHeads Against Racial Prejudice” and they seem pretty cool.
I also talked with two people I don’t know in the lunch line at school.
They were pretty cool fellas and it was cool to chat with some people I don’t normally chat with.
