I’m feeling like stopping this journal right now, but I’m going to try and keep going for a bit more and see if I can start enjoying it again.
Part of that might be because it feels like I don’t really have anything to say.
Anyway, today’s day was me going to school, driving, and watching youtube/netflix.
I’ve also been listening to the new genre￼ of music, not sure what I’d call it, but I like it.
