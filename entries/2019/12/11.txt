My grandmother has been giving me a lot of fruit lately, so today I ate a bunch of grapes and gave fruit to my friends.
After school I ate some left over pizza then went on my mom and I’s daily walk.
After the walk I brushed my teeth and then my brother, mother, and I all watched the movie “187” (1997).
The movie was alright but it was no masterpiece￼, and so I rated it 6/10.
