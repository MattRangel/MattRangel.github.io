Today was my last day of the school semester and so now I get a two week break.
After school I went over to my grandparents’ house for the afternoon.
My grandma had a lunch cooked and then for dinner I drove to Little Caesars to get pizzas for us.
When I got home from there I put on the movie “The Great Escape” (1968) which I’d rate 8/10.
It was a very good movie in a genre￼￼ I don’t always enjoy 100% of the time.
I’m going to bed pretty pretty late tonight.
I’m not suprised though because I was kind of expecting it to happen since I’m on my break now and don’t have to wake up early for school tomorrow.￼
