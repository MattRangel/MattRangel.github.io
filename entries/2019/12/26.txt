Today I drove my brother and dad to my grabdparents’ house where we all ate lumch.
After that my brother left to go hang out with a friend of his who lives in the same neighborhood￼.
I just hung out at my grandparents’ like I usually do.
I did drive my dad to get some clothes from thr dry cleaners and also get some gas for the car.
Once we got back from that we ate dinner and then headed home.
I hung out a little bit, and then I put on a movie for my dad and I.
The movie my dad chose was called “The Aeronauts” (2019).
It was a pretty good movie that had no problem keeping my attention.
I’m going to bed kind of late tonight but I’m hoping I’ll be able to slowly improve and go to bed earlier tomorrow night.
