The first half of today was pretty average with my brother and I going to my grandparents’ house and then eating lunch.
For dinner we waited for my dad to get back from florida.
After we all ate dinner we then all waited for my mom to get there from work so my grandparents could do a christmas prayer.
After we finished that we ate some desserts and then all drove home in our three seperate cars.
When I was just about to turn onto the driveway of my house a deer came out of nowhere and ran infront of my car.
Luckily I was able to slow down enough to where there was no damage done to the car.
Not so sure about the deer though.
I did see it get up and run away though so I’m pretty sure I didn’t kill it.
After I got home I put on the movie Die Hard, because I had it downloaded onto a usb.
I’ve recently learned that people watch that movie as a christmas movie, which I kind of understand, but thats what reminded me of it.
