Today was a pretty relaxed school day.
The one final exam I had today was physics which was not too difficult at all.
In all my other classes I was just chilling.
For dinner my dad made some soup which had brocoli, shrimp, and sausage￼.
I’m going to bed only an hour late tonight which isn’t too bad sense it’s the weekend.
