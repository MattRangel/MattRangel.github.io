Going to bed earlier than I did yesterday which is good progress!
This morning I hung out in my room till noon.
Once it got to be noon I got out of bed and went and ate lunch.
After I finished up eating lunch I went outside to continue helping my dad un-dent the car.
We did that all the way up till it was time to go to church.
After church there was a dinner because someone was having their aniversary.
After eating I drove my brother to pick up his two friends and then I drove them all to a ￼ quinceañera.
Following that I drove home and then watched half of an okay movie with my dad.
I turned off the movie because I was getting tired and it just wasn’t that great of a film.
So I brushed my teeth and then got into bed and am now about to got to sleep after looking at some music.
