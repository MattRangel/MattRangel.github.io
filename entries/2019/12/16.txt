Today was the second out of three days we are taking exams today at my school.
All the exams that were scheduled￼ I did not have to take though because I was exempt from taking them.
So that made today a pretty chill day.
Tomorrow I have to take my english exam and my history one.
I’m not looking too foward to having to take either of those.
I’m going to bed on time again, I’m hoping this week will turn out like last week and I’ll get good sleep on all the week days.
