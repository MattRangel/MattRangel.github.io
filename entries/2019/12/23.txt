I spent the day at my grandparents’ house today.
So when I wasn’t eating I was on my phone.
I didn’t really to much today besides those two things so this won’t be a long one.
I’m going to bed late tonight again :/ even though I got my teeth brushed early and everything.
I think the thing is is that I’ve just got to make more of a specific effort.
