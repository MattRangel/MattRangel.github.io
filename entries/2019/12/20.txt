I’m going to bed a little earlier than I did yesterday, but it’s still pretty late.
This afternoon I drove to walmart to buy some hair clippers.
After getting home I shaved my head all the way down to 2/8 of an inch.
I’m not sure if I’ll keep doing this, but for now my plan is to let it grow from here and see what it looks like.
I keep getting suprised when I look in the mirror because I forget that my hair is gone now.
