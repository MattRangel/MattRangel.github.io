This morning my dad told me to clean my car and so I got out of bed and started washing it.
By the time I was finishing up my dad was getting back home and so he helped me finished up the last little bit.
After finishing cleaning the car my family and I all ate the dinner that my dad made.
After the dinner my dad called me back outside to help him while he removed some dents from the car.
That process lasted until it was dark.
After coming inside from that I watched three movies.
The first one I watched with my mom and dad, the second one I watched with just my dad, and the third one I finished watching by myself.
So basically my whole day was just working on the car and then watching a few movies at the end.
I’m also going to bed very very late tonight, but I’m hoping I’ll be able to go to bed on time tomorrow.
Who knows though because that is the same thing I said yesterday haha.
