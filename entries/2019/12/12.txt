Tonight I talked with both my parents and we are going to cancel my next haircut appointment, because I’m going to try and cut my own hair.
I decided I’m going to try and cut it into a style and if I mess up then I’ll shave it all off.
Also today I was actually a bit tired during the school day which isn’t cool, because I’ve been making sure to do good at going to sleep on time.
I pretty sure it’s just my body adjusting to the new sleep schedule￼.
I’m going to bed on time again tonight which is probably￼ the longest run of good sleep nights I’ve had in a row.
Anothering thing, I watched two very good movies today.
The first one I watched was “Donnie Darko” (2001) which I rated 9/10.
The second movie I watched was “Paperhouse” (1988) which I rated 8/10.
I did pretty good at choosing movies today.
