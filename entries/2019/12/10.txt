Today was a very cold and rainy day.
Luckly I remembered￼ to bring my wind breaker to school today so I didn’t get too wet.
I do have a jacket that would’ve been better suited for today, but I forgot I had it until I had already left the house.
At school I took a physics test and a statistics test.
I think I did pretty good on both of them which is good.
I am also going to bed on time for the third night in a row!
What a success￼! ha ha!
