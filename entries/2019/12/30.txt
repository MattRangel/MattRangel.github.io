In the morning time after I woke up I just sat around at home on my phone.
Once it got to be about noon I drove my dad and brother to my grandparents’ house.
Over there we ate lunch and then my dad and I got back in the car and drove to the store.
My dad was needing to buy ingredients for food for the New Years party that we are going to tomorrow.
We had to drive to Walmart across the street after we finished shopping because HEB didn’t have any good limes.
The rest of the afternoon at my grandparents’ was pretty normal.
After getting home from there I washed the dishes which took quite a while (about 40 min).
When I finally finished washing the dishes my dad and I watched a few more episodes of our show that we started yesterday.
We did not watch as much as we did yesterday so I’m not going to bed too extreamly late tonight which it pretty good.
