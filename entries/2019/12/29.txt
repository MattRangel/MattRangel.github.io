I didnâ€™t wake up till close to noon today.
When I did finally wake up I ate some breakfast and then watched three movies with my brother.
Once I finished the third movie I went outside to the garage to help my dad work on the dents in the car some more.
We finished up working on the car for now which I am happy about.
After finishing with the car my dad found a TV show on netflix which we watched 7 episodes of in a row.
So because of all the TV watching I did I am now going to bed very super late.
