Today I did not wake up till about 1 in the afternoon.
That’s probably my messed up sleeping days finally catching up to me.
When I checked my phone after waking up I saw that there was a text from my dad that we were going tomy grandparents’ house in a few minutes.
So I got ready and then we all went there for lunch.
Once I ate lunch I just hung out a bit till we left at around 5:30.
We had a New Years party to go to so when we got home we got ready for that and then waited for my mom to get home from work.
At the beginning of the party I did not have the most fun.
There was good food to eat though which evened￼ it out.
So I was just eating and playing board games with my brother and two other little kids until it was time for my family to go to my grandparents for a little bit.
We were going to my grandparents’ so that we could celebrate New Years at 11pm with them.
About 25min after 11pm my family all got back into the car and drove back to the party we were at.
I didn’t really want to go back to that party but I decided it would be best if I did just go and create less of a hassle for my parents by staying behind at my grandparents’.
So once we got back my brother and I went up stairs to the room of the boy who lives in the house we were at.
There he let my brother and I play on his Xbox.
At first I chose a game that was not to great but after changing the game to mincecraft the boy joined and played with us.
So that’s what I did for the rest of the time at the part.
obviously taking a break for the New Years countdown though.
Now I’m back at home and I’m going to bed at a not so desirable time.
The only thing I’m going to hope for at this point is for me to be able to adjust to my school sleep schedule￼￼ quickly haha!
