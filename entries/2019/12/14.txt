For lunch my faimly all went to eat a cracker barrel with and old friend of my mom and that friend’s family.
After getting home from cracker barrel I drove over to my friend Ben’s house where him, my other friend Darious, and I all played basket ball and did some swimming.
After getting home from that I drove with my brother to walmart to get snacks plus gas.
When we got home from walmart I put on the movie “Fight Club” which was alright.
I’m also going to bed late tonight, but hopefully I won’t feel too bad in the morning tomorrow.
