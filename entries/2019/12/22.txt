I didn’t have too much energy today and I’m thinking it’s because of all the walking/climbing around I did yesterday plus me going kind of late last night.
Since I was tired I didn’t do a whole lot today.
I also ate a lot of pizza for lunch and breakfast.
For church today my mom took my brother and I to a different church than we normally go to.
I liked the music at this church better then the music at the church we go to normally.
I wanted to go to bed at a better time tonight but that did not happen.
I think that it’s because I don’t “have” to wake up for anything in the morning during this winter break unlike during a school week where I have to wake up early to go to school.
