For lunch today I drove my brother and I out to meet my mom and eat pizza.
The pizza that I got was BBQ sauce, chicken, cheese, and onions.
It was very good and I’m looking foward to eating the leftovers tomorrow for breakfast.
After eating lunch we all drove to Goodwill for my brother to get some clothes.
Following Goodwill I seperated ways woth my brother and mom and drove to my friends house.
With my friend we went to a park and walked around/explored for a couple hours until it started to get dark.
Once we got done with the park a second friend met up with us and we all three went to dinner at taco bell.
My taco bell meal was pretty good.
After finally getting home from that long day I decorated the christmas tree with my mom.
I’m still going to bed late but I’m not going to bed past 12am which is good progress￼.
