December 25, 2019!
Today was christmas!
The first thing I did this morning after brushing my teeth and waking up my family was open my stocking.
After opening the stockings my brother and I started opening the presents.
I got some very cool stuff which I’m very happy about.
After that we all just hung out at home till the afternoon.
We drove to my grandparents’ house for dinner and to open the presnts from them.
Once we got home from that my dad and I watched a couple movies to end the night off.
