I watched the fourth rambo movie today after school, I’d rate it an 8/10 like the first three, although the earlier ones did feel like they had a little bit more story to them. While watching the movie I ate some oatmeal and then afterwards I made some ramen with peanut butter for the second time in my life. I’d suggest to try it at least once it’s pretty unique.
