I watched the fourth rambo movie today after school, I’d rate it an 8/10 like the first three, although the earlier ones did feel like they had a little bit more story to them. 
While watching the movie I ate some oatmeal and then afterwards I made some ramen with peanut butter for the second time in my life. 
I’d suggest to try peanut butter in ramen at least once it’s pretty unique. I’m still not sure if I like it or not though.
