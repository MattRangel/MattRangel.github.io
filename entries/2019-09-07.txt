September 7, 2019
Today I watched movies and played games on my laptop (my brother played on the computer with me for one of those hours)
I watched Shazam (2019) which I rate 6/10. It was pretty good for a super hero movie which I donâ€™t always super enjoy.
Later in the day I watched It (1990) which was a 7/10. It had a good story and was able to keep my attention/interest for the whole three hours the movie takes.
