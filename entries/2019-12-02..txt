First day back to school today after thanksgiving break.
I had to catch up on the work that I missed on the days I was out of school for my wisdom teeth removal like a week and a half ago.
I was not looking foward to having to catch up on all the work I missed out on and I think it was even bringing me down a little at the beginning if the day.
By noon though I had finished catching up on my missing work and I felt pretty good.
My jaw is also now almost back to it’s normal not sore state.
The holes from where my teeth were are a little bit of an annoyance for me because I get a paranoid about not fully cleaning then good, but I’m getting over that which is good.
