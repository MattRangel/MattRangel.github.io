Today was anothe pretty lazy day.
After church this night my dad and I went and got some sandwiches￼￼.
I got a beef one with swiss cheese, mayo, and bbq sauce.
I ate it once I got home and then washed the dishes and brushed my teeth after.
I’m going to bed at a perfect time tonight so hopefully I can keep it going through the whole school week.
Also this weekend went by very very fast to me.
