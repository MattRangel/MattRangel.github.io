After I finished eating breakfast I went to my cousins house to finish building the mini golf course we had started build yesterday. After we finished my cousin, my brother and I all went swimming in the pool. Then that night my cousin, uncle, brother, and I set off some fireworks that were left over from New Years. I also finished building my website after all the fireworks got used up.
