Today was a pretty average schoolday.
I’m not able to clean the holes in my mouth from my wisdom teeth removal as easily now that I’m back in school which is not cool.
I’m hopping for the holes to close up soon so that I can not have to think about the possibility￼ of food being in there.
I didn’t go to my grandparents house after school today because it’s wednesday today.
I cooked up some Mac N Cheese all by myself for my dinner.
I also watched the movie “Slacker” (1990) which I rated 8/10.
I really liked it because of how different it is compared to the normal/mainstream movies I normally watch, and also the idea of the movie was very good and well executed￼￼.
