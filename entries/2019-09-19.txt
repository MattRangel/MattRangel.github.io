Today I’m going to bed at a good time continuing my streak of well rested days.
Also I drove my brother to his quinceanera practice today for the second time now.
Driving away from there let me listen to Awolnation (favorite band for a period of my life) again who I haven’t listened to in a very long while, so that was nice.
