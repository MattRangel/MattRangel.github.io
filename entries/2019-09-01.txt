Basically all I did today was watch movies with only one break to go to church.
When I woke up I pulled up the movie "They Live" (1998) which I’d probably give a 6/10. After the movie finished I spent the rest of the time I was at home watching the forst three Rambo movies. Those were all pretty good solid 8/10s.
During the movies I did the thing where you eat until you’re full and then immediately eat some more again once you lose the full feeling. 
My movie diet consisted of: A ham and cheese sandwhich, marshmellows, gummy bears, amd grapes.
I feel pretty good right now though which suprises me, because I thought I’d have to sleep with an upset stomach!
