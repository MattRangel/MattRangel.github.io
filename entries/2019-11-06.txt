After school my dad had korean food (pretty sure that is what it was) prepared which was very good.
It was much better than the left over Mac-N-Cheese I had planned to eat after school.
I was espicially hungry because all I ate at school for lunch was an apple and some grapes.
I only ate a bit of fruit for lunch because I was waiting in the long school lunch line to get some chicken nuggets.
But when I got towards the front of the line it looked like they only had spicy chicken wings, which I donâ€™t like.
So i just went back to my table and ate the apple I had in my bag which I was planning to have eatten earlier.
My friend came and sat down at my table and it turns out there was chicken nuggets I just did not see them, but at that point I did nit care enough to get back up and get some.
Plus the apple and grapes were enough to not make me so so hungry.
