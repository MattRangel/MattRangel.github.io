Today I completely redesigned the home page of my website which I've been wanting to do for a few months now.
Also as you can probably see, I'm retrying this journaling thing which I stopped doing after one day last time I tried haha!
(You can find that entry from July 14th 2018 here: http://mattrangel.net/entries/2018-07-14.txt)
I also went to Acadamey with my mom and brother which reminded me that following someone around while they try on shoes isn't the most fun thing in the world.
Towards the end of the night I drew a couple photos which I enjoyed, I might dedicate more time towards pen sketching so I can get better.
