This after noon I met my friends Ben and Darious at the movie theater to watch the movie Joker.
After the movie we went to Ben’s house to swim and hang out.
Following us eating at Ben’s house we then all went to Darious’ house to play darts and pool which led us into the night time and I went home from there afterwards.
