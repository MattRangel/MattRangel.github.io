I fell asleep without remembering to write this one, which I think is like the second time that has happened.
Not too bad considering how long I’ve been doing this now.
Anyway, yesterday my mom and I chose to move my wisdom teeth removal from the 22nd to the 21st because the 22nd was no longer available.￼
