June 15, 2021 - Tuesday
This morning I reheated myself some beef stew, rice, and corn bread for breakfast.
After eating I headed over to the post office to send my dad the paper I had notarized yesterday and my temporary Colombian ID.
Then I headed back home where I just hung out in my room for a bit.
Later on my aunt Annette offered to make me some oatmeal for lunch.
After eating I also had an orange.
Then my aunt asked me if I could sort some paperwork for her.
The sorting wasn't too hard and after I finished it felt good having done something productive for the day.
I didn't really have any attention to watch a movie today so mostly I just hung out watching short videos or chatting with friends.
My new water bottle came in the mail today which was nice, because before that I was having to go to the kitchen for a cup of water every time I was thirsty.
For dinner my unlce Oscar and aunt prepared chicken wings, corn on the cob, and mashed potatoes with gravy.
After eating my aunt and I watched a couple episodes of "Money Heist" (2017).
Once we finsihed watching for the night I went back to my room.
I was about to go back to hanging out on my phone then my friend Lucy messaged me that her and my other friend Tabby were getting on Roblox.
So I played with them for a while and then a little while more by myself after they got off.
After getting off I got ready for bed and then went to sleep.
I cut it close a little with the time I got off my computer, but it all turned out fine and I went to bed right about on time.
