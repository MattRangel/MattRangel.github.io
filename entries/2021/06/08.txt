June 8, 2021 - Tuesday
Today I woke up bright and early for my last day of school.
Towards the end of my school day I ate some oatmeal and peanuts for breakfast.
As I was finishing that I also finished my last class.
Then I went downstairs and hung out on my phone for a bit.
Later on I had some rice and beans from yesterday as a part two to my breakfast.
Then I went back down stairs and took a nap until my dad finished making lunch.
For lunch he made sweet and sour chicken and rice.
Afterwards I went back to hanging out on my phone until it was time to go.
I was originally going to leave early in the morning for the airport tomorrow, but my mom thought up the idea to spend the night at her friend Jenny’s house.
So my mom and I headed over there after my mom finished her work day.
We got to Jenny’s house and then Jenny, her daughter / my friend Kaitlyn, Jenny’s husband, my mom, and I all drove together out to a restaurant.
I split a meatloaf melt with my mom and then had some cheesecake for dessert.
Next Kaitlyn and I went back to her house to drop off her dad, who was ready to go to sleep.
Kaitlyn and I then went back to town to met back up with our moms.
After finding them I took Kaitlyn to the gas station accross the street, so I could get some lottery tickets.
I won at first then spent some winnings to get another scratch off ultimately breaking even.
After that we sat back down with moms until they were ready to go.
Once we got back to the house we all hung out down stairs in the room where I’d be sleeping for a while.
After we all cleared out of there I started getting ready for bed.
In the middle of that Kaitlyn showed my mom and I a tour of her room.
Next I finished getting ready for bed and then shortly went to bed after changing.
Didn’t go to bed close to on time at all tonight, but luckily I wont be having to wake up super early any more after tomorrow.
