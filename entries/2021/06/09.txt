June 9, 2021 - Wednesday
Woke up early to get ready to head back to Florida on the plane this morning.
After I finished getting ready I went upstairs with my mom and talked with her friend Jenny and daugher / my friend Kaitlyn.
For breakfast I had three different granola bars and then we were on our way.
We left a little late, but I was still able to get to my gate with a good chunk of time to spare.
The first plane ride was the shorter of the two and I just watched a few downloaded YouTube videos.
The second flight I started out watching a not too interesting movie.
That just made me tired, so I switched to listening to music a dozed off.
Once the snacks were brought I switched to watching YouTube again.
For my drink I got a cranberry juice, which I had seen the person next to me choose last week.
After watching YouTube I started the movie “The Untouchables” (1987), which lasted me until the end of the plane ride.
Getting off the plane I didn’t have to wait outside for too long before my aunt Jenny pulled up.
She took me to my aunt grandma Lucy’s house, where I had chicken rice and pizza for a late lunch.
After eating I headed back home.
Shortly after getting home dinner was finished, but since I had just eatten I wasn’t hungry.
So I hung out in my room for a while eventually coming out once I was hungry.
I watched another movie called “The Gentlemen” (2019).
After finishing the movie I just hung out on my phone and chatted with friends for a good while.
I ended up not getting ready for bed and going to sleep until it was very late.
Even though I’m not waking up super early anymore I’m still going to try going to bed at the same time each night.
