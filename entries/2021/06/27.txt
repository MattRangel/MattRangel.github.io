June 27, 2021 - Sunday
Note: I’m writing this one a few days late since I’ve been so tired.
Spent my morning today packing for my Trip to Texas and then Colombia.
I packed all the way until it was time to go pretty much.
Before leaving I went to the supermarket and got some snacks for the road with my aunt.
After loading up my car I headed over to my sister’s house.
We said hello and then went out to go eat at a Peruvian restaurant.
Once we finished eating we headed back to her apartment and hung out there for a bit.
She was busy packing up her things to move, so I didn’t stay for a super long time.
I hit the road and then drove into the night.
