June 17, 2021 - Thursday
I started my day early this morning after not being able to fall back asleep due to itchy bug bites.
For breakfast I reheated myself some beef stew and rice.
Later on went to my school to go pick up my diploma.
After that I just hung out for pretty much the rest of the day.
I got a band shirt in the mail today.
For lunch I made plain oatmeal with banana.
For dinner we ordered out and I got a beef gyro and sweet potatoe fries.
After eating I watched an episode of “Money Heist” (2017) with my aunt Annette.
Following that I hung out in my room for a while.
I got distracted which put me getting ready for bed at a late time.
That didn’t really matter though, because afterwards I stayed up even more.
I wasn’t very motivated to go to bed on time tonight, because I felt like I would have the same troubles falling asleep again.
