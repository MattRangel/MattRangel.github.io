June 23, 2021 - Wednesday
Today was another hangout day, but it felt a bit more productive since I watched movies.
For breakfast I reheated some rice and chicken and also cut myself a mango.
While I ate I started watching the first movie of the day called “Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World” (2003).
Following that movie the next one I watched was called “Serpico” (1973).
While I was watching these movies I was also calling on the phone with my dad as he planned our trip to Colombia.
We ended up deciding it would be best for me to drive back home to Texas, so then we could all fly out together.
Then my dad found some tickets very soon - only a week and a half away!
Initially I planned to leave Saturday night, but in order￼ to be able to see my sister I decided to switch to Sunday night instead.
For lunch my aunt Annette made some empanadas.
After finishing the movie I watched another called “Looper” (2012).
Next I finished watching a movie I had started several days ago called “Fearless” (1993).
Right as that movie was ending my aunt finished making dinner.
So I switched over the TV to watch a few episodes of “Money Heist” (2017) with her.
For dinner she made lentil pasta topped with red sauce, sausage, and peppers.
After we stopped watching TV I got ready for bed.
I did go to bed a little late, but I made sure it was too late so my sleeping can get as good as possible before I leave for Texas.
