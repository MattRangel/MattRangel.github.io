June 26, 2021 - Saturday
Had a long day for running around today.
Called an oil change place to see how long the walk in waot would be.
Then I scheduled an appointment for my tire rotation.
Next for breakfast my uncle Oscar made biscuits with eggs and gravy on top.
Then I went back to my room until it was time for my appointment.
Getting my tires rotated didn’t take very long.
However doing the oil change did, because I wasn’t able to make an appointment.
Next I went over to a clothing store to pick up some shirts my aunt Annette bought for my uncle Jorge and I.
Following that I headed over to my aunt grandma Lucy’s house to pick up some more things to take to family on my trip back to Texas.
While I was there I Lucy gave me some rice, beans, chicken, yucca, potatoe, and string bean salad.
After I finished eating I loaded up my cooler with the things that needed to stay cold and then I was on my way.
Once I got back home I put the cooler things back into the refrigerator.￼
Next I worked on cleaning up my things in my room until dinner was ready.
For dinner my aunt made Chinese chicken and rice.
While we ate and for a while afterwards my aunt and I watched the show “Money Heist” (2017).
Once we stopped watching I went to my room and started hanging out on my phone.
That’s where I messed up going to bed on time.
Once I finally did get up and get ready for bed it was a bit late.
Holefully I’ll be able to sleep in to make up the time.
