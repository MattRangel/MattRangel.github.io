June 1, 2021 - Tuesday
The only school work I had today was an exam for my economics class.
It wasn’t even for a grade, so I finished it pretty quickly.
After that I spent a while just watching YouTube videos.
Later on I watched the movie “Howl’s Moving Castle” (2004).
For lunch I had a panini which my aunt Annette made for me and an apple.
During my last class of the day I paused the movie and talked on the phone with my mom.
By the time we were done talking my last class had ended.
Then I went to Walmart to buy a picnic blanket.
On my drive there I talked on the phone with my mom some more.
Once I got back home I went back to my room and watched YouTube for a while.
Then I remembered I never finished watching the movie, so I did that.
Afterwards I went back to just hanging out until dinner.
For dinner my aunt made chicken, rice with corn, green beans, and macaroni.
Following dinner I went back to my room for a bit again.
Then I got up out of bed and got ready for bed and took a shower.
After finishing all that I played Minecraft on the computer with my friend Sherry until it was time for me to go to bed.
Went to bed right about on time tonight.
