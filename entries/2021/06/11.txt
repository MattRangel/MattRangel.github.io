June 11, 2021 - Friday
Woke up a bit tired today, because I still have fixed my sleeping schedule.
For breakfast I had a bagle with some cream cheese on it and I also reheated a bowl of fried rice.
Instead of toasting the bagle I used the microwave, because I didn’t feel like figuring out how to use the mini oven.
I spent the first part of my day watching YouTube videos.
Then I ate a snack of plantain chips and apple slices with peanut butter.
While I ate I started watching the movie “Requiem for a Dream” (2000).
After the movie ended I went back to hanging out on my phone, but I started to go crazy from only having done that.
So I went outside and pogo sticked for a tiny bit to get my heart pumping.
Once I came back inside I pulled the photos off my camera, which I had taken with my friend Sherry a few weeks ago.
After sending them to her I went back to hanging out on my phone.
Wgen my aunt Annette got back from for I helped her bring in some water jugs from the car.
Then I put my laundry in the washing machine.
For dinner we had reheated fried rice, chicken, and french fries.
While we ate my aunt and I watched a few more episodes of “Money Heist” (2017).
By the time we finished watching for the night my laundry had finished drying.
I took it to my room and then tried on different clothes to see what I’d wear tomorrow.
After finally deciding on an outfit I got started on folding my laundry.
Once I finished folding I got ready for bed and took a shower.
I ended up going to bed late again tonight, but definitely much closer to my target time tonight at least.
