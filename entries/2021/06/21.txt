June 21, 2021 - Monday
Fell asleep without writing this one, so Iâ€™m writing it the next night.
Had my alarm set to wake up early this morning, but I woke up before it anyways.
Today I went with my aunt Annette and uncle Oscar to their work.
On the drive there I had an egg sandwich from the lunch box my aunt packed me.
Once we got to the warehouse I got to work helping my uncle unpack machines.
For lunch I had the panini and oatmeal that my aunt packed me.
Once we got home I took a shower and then hung out on my phone for a bit.
Hanging out on my phone turned into a nap after I started getting tired.
For dinner my aunt made pot pie.
Following dinner I went back to sleep.
Since it was now late at this point I ended up falling for the night.
