June 22, 2021 - Tuesday
After getting out of bed this morning my aunt Annette made a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast.
Then I went back to my room and just hung out on my phone.
Today was a pretty chill day of just relaxing.
For lunch my aunt made me a tuna sandwich.
hung out a while more, and then for dinner we had chicken, and rice.
While we ate my aunt and I watched a few episodes of the TV show “Money Heist” (2017).
Following that I got ready for bed and took a shower.
Then I hung out for a bit longer, but I did good at stopping when it became late.
Went to bed right on time tonight.
