June 7, 2021 - Monday
Had to wake up pretty early this morning to do my online school.
Later in the morning while I was still in call I went upstairs and had a pop tart.
For my lunch break I had a deli sandwich from yesterday.
While I was eating my uncle Mike, cousin David, and cousin Dagan came home from work on their lunch break.
After finishing lunch I went back down stairs and hung out on my phone while I waited for class to start.
I actually dozed off while I was watching a video still pretty tired.
After stitting through my last class I just hung out on my phone for a while and sat with my brother.
Then my cousin Dagan came home and I listened to him talk with my brother.
I also went outside throught the day a couple times to pet the cats and dogs.
After seeing a tick on my shin trying to latch on me I came back inside and took a shower.
Later on I had another sandwhich, which my dad made for me.
Then David, Dagan, my brother, and I all went outside and played basketball for a while.
Once we came back inside I played an indoor putt putt game with Dagan 
In the middle of the game my dad finished cooking dinner.
For dinner he made black beans, rice, and eggs.
Then I took another shower before going to Walmart with my cousins and brother to get some movie night snacks.
At Walmart I got some generic brand golden rasins, gummies, and ice cream sandwiches.
The movie we watched was called “Prisoners” (2013).
I didn’t realize this until half way through the movie, but I actually had already seen it when I was little.
During the movie I ate a bit too much sugar.
Following the movie I got ready for bed and went to sleep.
Didn’t go to bed at the best time considering I have to wake up early again for school tomorrow morning.
On the bright side that’ll be my last day for school for this year.
