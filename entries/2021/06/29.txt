June 29, 2021 - Tuesday
Woke up early this morning only because I went to bed so early yesterday.
After waking up I brushed my teeth and then had warm cereal with bananas.
Next I took my grandparents’ trash and then headed home.
Once I got home I unpacked my car with the help if my brother.
Then I did some home surgery on all my ant bites.
After that I made some different teas.
The first one was basil and cinnamon.
Next one was made of dasiy leaves and roots.
While my second one was seeping I headed over to the post office real quick to return something for my dad.
Soon after getting back home I headed right back out again with my brother.
At my grandparents’ house my grandmother just had eye surgery, which meant she couldn’t cook so I helped with that.
For lunch we all had lasagna.
While lunch was being made and after lunch I watched the movie “The Heist of the Century” (2020).
After that movie I watched another movie called “Spirited Away” (2001).
Next I took a shower and had some more lasagna for dinner.
After eating my brother and I headed over to Sonic to meet some old friends.
We all ended up talking quite a while there.
Then once we did get home I didn’t go to bed until very late.
