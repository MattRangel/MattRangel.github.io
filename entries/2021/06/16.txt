June 16, 2021 - Wednesday
All of today was just a hang out day.
Didn’t go anywhere and didn’t do much of anything.
For breakfast I reheated beef stew and rice.
For lunch my aunt Annette made me a bowl of oatmeal.
Lastly for dinner my aunt made a pot pie.
Throughout the day I was also tempted to have sugary stuff, but I did good and not submitting.
After dinner I watched some of the TV show “Money Heist” (2017) with my aunt.
While we watched I paused the show to talk on the phone with my mom for a bit.
After watching TV I went back to my room for a while before getting ready for bed and taking a shower.
I ended up getting distracted in those before and after areas which led to me going to bed late.
