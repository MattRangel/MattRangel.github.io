June 5, 2021 - Saturday
Automatically woke up at my usual time tonight even though I went to bed late, so I was a bit tired throughout the day.
For breakfast my dad made everyone egg sandwiches.
I helped toast and butter the bread.
Then I helped my uncle bob carry some things out to his car.
Later on we all headed over to the hotel early to help decorate the room  for my grandparents’ 60th anniversary.
Once my uncle Mike got there with cousins David and Dagan my brother and I hung out with them.
We went down the road with them while their dad got them new phones.
By the time we got back more people were starting to come.
There ended up being lots of friends and family.
After the party I headed back to uncle Bob’s house with my mom and dad.
I hung out in the living room for a while and talked and played with my little cousin James and the dog.
I also had a bowl of rice pudding.
Then we all went outside and sat for a bit.
I shortly came back inside and got ready for bed, because it was late.
Didn’t go to bed at a very good time again tonight.
