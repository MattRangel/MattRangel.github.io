Started my day very early this morning.
Four hour drive north to see me friend Jose (he is also the son of my Dad’s good friend).
He is in the Colombian Navy and his boat was docked at one of the bases here.
On the drive for my breakfast I had the sandwich my aunt Annette made me yesterday.
Since the drive was so long I spent pretty much the whole day hanging out with him.
He still had to work giving tours to people here and there, but I was able to tag along.
I also got to meet some of his friends that he works with.
For lunch Jose gave me his sancocho he didn’t want.
Since he wasn’t able to go far from the ship I went to a shop for him and got him some things he asked for.
Then we had donuts that someone else brought.
I left before dinner time, because I still had a long drive back home and didn’t want to get back super late.
On my way back home I stopped at a Publix to get a can of coconut water.
They didn’t have the kind I like, so I decided to try out a different one.
It was with added sugar, and I think that’s why it made me feel gross a while after finishing it.
Once I got home I talked with my aunt for a bit before getting ready for bed.
Went to bed a bit late tonight, but thankfully I’m not waking up early for anything.
