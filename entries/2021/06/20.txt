June 20, 2021 - Sunday
Had my alarm set to wake up early this morning, but I ended up waking up even earlier on my own.
Only had a small breakfast of a bagel with cream cheese in order to save space for lunch.
For Father’s Day my aunt Annette and I went over to aunt Jenny’s house.
Other there we hung out with other fanily.
Lunch was shredded beef sandwiches and fruit.
On our way back home my aunt stopped and bought a shelf from someone.
We also stopped at publix.
By the time we got home I was very exhausted.
I hung out in the kitchen while I waited for dinner.
For dinner my uncle Oscar prepared chicken wings, tater tots, and corn.
While we ate my aunt and I watched “Money Heist” (2017).
Next I wemt back to my room and hung out for a bit too long putting me to bed a bit late.
Not as late as last night, but still pretty off target.
