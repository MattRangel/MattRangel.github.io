June 18, 2021 - Friday
I woke up and had to stay up for a while, because I couldn’t fall back asleep due to bug bite and sun burn itchiness.
Later on I became tired enough to fall back asleep for a bit more.
For breakfast I finished the last of the beef stew and rice leftovers.
I also had a cup of tea and watched the movie “Incredibles 2” (2018), which I had started last weekend.
Then I just hung out in my room for a while.
For my lunch I had oatmeal with bananas in it.
That means I had the same exact breakfast and lunch today as I did yesterday.
Following lunch I drove over to the pharmacy real quick to buy some antihistamines for my itchiness.
Once I got back home I went back to hanging out in my room until a little before dinner.
I came and sat in the living room and chatted with my uncle Oscar and aunt Annette.
My aunt and I watched a few episodes of “Money Heist” (2017).
For dinner we had open faced tacos.
Following dinner I had a banana and watched some more of the show with my aunt.
Once we stopped I took the antihistamine and started getting ready for bed.
By the time I finished taking a shower it felt like they kicked in.
I went to bed a little late tonight, but still pretty close to on schedule.
