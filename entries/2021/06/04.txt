June 4, 2021 - Friday
Woke up early again this morning to check into all my classes.
Didn’t have any work in my classes, so I all really had to do was sit through them.
In the morning I finished watching the documentary I started a few days ago called “Africa: Blood and Guts” (1966).
After finishing school my aunt grandma Lucy made some pasta and meatballs for lunch.
Then I hung out with my cousin Elena for a bit.
Later on I took a shower and switched my clothes into the ones I’d be flying to Iowa in.
Next I downloaded some movies and YouTube videos to watch on the plane.
Then I just hung out until my aunt Jenny came over to take me to the airport along with my cousin Mathias.
Figuring out what to do at the airport was a little confusing at times, but I figured out everything in the end.
I had to take two planes to get to Iowa.
On the first plane ride I listened to music, watched YouTube, and then watched the movie “Twister” (1996).
My second flight ended up getting delayed and so I had to wait for quite a while.
During the second plane ride I watched another YouTube video.
Then I watched a little bit more of the “Twister” movie.
Once I landed I went outside and met with friends Kaitlyn and her mom Jenny.
They took me to a gas station where we got a few things to eat and to met my mom and uncle Bob.
After talking for a while we parted ways and I headed home with my mom and Bob.
Once we got to Bob’s house I got ready for bed and went to sleep.
It was already pretty late for me to go to bed, and adjusting for the time change it was very late for me.
