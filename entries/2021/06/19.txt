June 19, 2021 - Saturday
I slept good this morning and my bug bites and sunburn mostly stopped itching.
For breakfast my aunt Annette made grits, eggs, bacon, and muffins.
After finishing I stayed out in the living room and watched YouTube with my uncle Oscar.
Then I went back to my room and hung out there for a while.
For lunch I had a bowl of oatmeal with tiny apple cubes in it.
While I ate I talked on the phone with my dad and then later my brother.
After eating I went and ran some errands with my aunt.
Once we got back I went back to my room for a tiny bit.
I came right back out to make some cookies for us to have and to bring some for Father’s Day tomorrow.
By the time I finished making the cookies dinner was also finished.
For dinner my uncle made beef sandwhiches with onions, mushrooms, peppers, and cheese.
While we had been cooking and while we ate dinner my aunt and I watched some more episodes of “Money Heist” (2017).
After finishing the show for the noght I went to my room and ended up not really paying attention to the time.
I ended up going to bed pretty late.
