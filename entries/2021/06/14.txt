June 14, 2021 - Monday
I didn’t have too much attention to watch a full movie today, so on and off I continued the movie “Fearless” (1993) from yesterday throughout the day today.
While I wasn’t watching the movie I just hung out on my phone.
I also read a tiny bit, but not for tool long.
For breakfast my aunt Annette made me some oatmeal with banana and golden rasins.
For lunch my aunt made me a sandwich.
Later on around noon I printed out a paper saying my dad could pick up my Colombian ID for me from the consulate.
Then I got in my car and looked for somewhere to get the document notarized.
It turns out that the notary has to be able to read the language the document is in, and not too many notaries that I could find spoke spanish.
I eventually did find one though just kind of far away and not open until later in the afternoon.
So after calling with her and confirming she’d be able to do it I went back inside.
I just hung out in my room for a while until it was time to go.
Once I got to the office the doors were still locked.
I ended up waiting a little under an hour and a half before she came and opened up the office.
Not sure if it was because I miss heard what she said on the phone or if she told me wrong by mistake.
But anyways once she opened it only took a couple minutes for her to notarize the paper.
On my way back home I stopped at a office store to get some tape.
Once I got home I worked on the little scrapbook thing I have with my friend Sherry.
Then I got ready for bed and took a shower.
I stayed up a little bit more after that, but did good at not over doing it and went to bed at a good time.
