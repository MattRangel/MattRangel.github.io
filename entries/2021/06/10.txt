June 10, 2021 - Thursday
Woke up late this morning.
After getting ready for the day I had a panini my aunt Annette made me for lunch.
Then I drove over to my school to let them make a copy of my social security number card.
I had to wait for the lady to get there, because she wasn’t in her office at first.
Once I got back home I watched the movie “Project X￼” (2012) and ate a mango.
After the movie I hung out on my phone until it was dinner time.
For dinner we had chili dogs.
I stayed in the living room and watched TV with my uncle Oscar for a bit before going back to my room.
Then I got on my computer and played Minecraft with my friends Ben and Darious for a bit.
After we got off I got ready for bed, but I didn’t actually go to bed.
Instead I ended up staying up too late since I got distracted on my phone.
