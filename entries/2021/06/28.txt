June 28, 2021 - Monday
Today was my second day of driving from Florida to Texas all alone.
Had a few mishaps trying to pee in different places.
The worst one being getting a ton on ant bites on my leg from going in the grass.
I only slep like two hours at a rest stop before hitting the road again.
For a midnight snack I had the rest of my Peruvian food leftover from yesterday.
Once I finally got home I had the lunch my grandma prepared for me.
Then I went and layed in bed where I fell asleep for the rest of the day.
