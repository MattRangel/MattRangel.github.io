June 6, 2021 - Sunday
Spent this morning hanging out at uncle Bob’s house.
Then I headed out with my mom and dad to go to my mom’s friend Mary’s house.
She made tacos for dinner.
Then I played outside a bit with the kids.
Next we drove down to their farm and looked at the animals.
Once we got back my mom, dad, and I headed out to uncle Mikes house.
We got there pretty late.
Once I got inside I got ready for bed and went to sleep.
