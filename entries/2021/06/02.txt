June 2, 2021 - Wednesday
I had a tiny bit of school work today which entailed drawing a small photo and correcting a worksheet.
Besides that I watched a documentary on my phone called “Africa: Blood and Guts” (1966).
Later on in my school day I called with my mom for a bit.
After getting off the phone with her I started packing to fly to Iowa.
My flight isn’t until Friday, but I decided to spend a few days at my aunt grandma Lucy’s house.
Once school was over I ate the tuna sandwich my aunt Annette made me for lunch.
Then I took a shower and finished getting packed.
After saying goodbye I headed out.
Once I got to Lucy’s house my little cousin Elena and her mom were also there.
I played with my cousin for a while until it was time for her to go.
To eat I had some mango then for dinner I had shredded beef, lentils, coconut rice, bread, and plantain chips.
Then I just hung out in the living room for a while and watched TV with Lucy.
They had a bunch of mangos, so Lucy thought up the idea to give me some to give to my friend Sherry when I see her tomorrow.
Once I got settled into my room I went back to watching the documentary I had started earlier.
Then worked on figuring out my plan of day with Sherry tomorrow.
Next I got ready for bed.
Did good at getting ready for bed on time, which left me some spare time to hang out a bit more before going to soeep.
