June 12, 2021 - Saturday
Didn’t have to wake up to my alarm this morning since I woke up before it.
After I got up I got my teeth brushed and then had an orange for breakfast.
Then I just hung out until it was closer to time for me to go.
Once it was that time I took a shower and then got dressed.
I was about to go and then my aunt Annette offered to make me something to eat.
She made me a sandwhich and then I was on my way.
After picking up my friend Sherry we went to her friend Ace’s house and picked her up too.
I drove us all to a train station where we took two trains to get to a mall.
The mall we ended up going to wasn’t really all that great.
After we finished looking at all the things there were to look at we walked over to a Target to get something to eat.
We ended up choosing mini pizzas and a jug of juice.
After we finished eating we headed back to the train station.
As we were buying our tickets the train we wanted to get on pulled up and went away without us.
Luckily there was other one coming a little late.
Unluckily that meant we missed the second train we planned to get on, and the next one didn’t come for several hours.
Since Ace couldn’t get home super late Sherry called her dad, who picked us all up and dropped Ace off at her house and me off at my car.
Once I got back home I ate a couple pastries that my uncle Oscar’s sister had bought.
Then I hung out in my room a tiny bit before getting ready for bed.
I still want to start going to bed on time, but today wasn’t the best day to start on.
