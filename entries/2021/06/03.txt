June 3, 2021 - Thursday
Today was my second day at my aunt grandma Lucy’s house.
I had to do my school calls from my phone and the all really dragged on.
I ended up leaving my last two a little early after checking in.
For breakfast Lucy made me some scrambled eggs with ham.
While I was sitting in the calls I hung out on my phone and watched some more of the documentary I started yesterday called “Africa: Blood and Guts” (1966).
I was supposed to take Lucy somewhere, but someone else ended up taking her.
After getting out of my English class I hung oit in the living room and saw my cousin Elena again.
Then I headed out to go hang out with my friend Sherry.
First I made her close her eyes and took her to a couple joke places.
Then we went and got some things to have for lunch.
At a Japanese market we got some sushi.
Then we went to publix and each got drinks.
After that we went to a park.
The park I found was a pretty cool one with not too many people and big space.
Once we finished eating we sat and talked for a while.
Then we walked one of the trails the park had.
Next we looked at some baby frogs in the pond.
Afterwards we went back to my car to look for something else to do, but it ended up getting late.
I wasn’t able to stay out as late since I was staying at Lucy’s house.
After dropping Sherry off I headed back to Lucy’s.
There I had some chicken, rice, bread, and plantain chips for dinner.
Then I stayed up a bit too late on my phone before getting ready for bed.
