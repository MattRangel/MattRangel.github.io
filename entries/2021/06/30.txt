June 30, 2021 - Wednesday
Woke up early again today even though my alarm was set for much later.
After getting up I just hung out for a bit until it was time to go to my grandparents’ house.
Today I took them to the doctor so my grandma could get her bandages removed from her eye.
Before leaving we had shrimp pasta for lunch.
Once we got back I hung out in my room for a bit.
Then I had another serving of shrimp pasta for dinner.
I had an early dinner today, so I could be home already when my mom got home with my dad and brother.
I parked my car in a hidden spot then hid in my mom’s closet to scare her when she went in there.
Next we started watching the movie “The Ninth Configuration” (1980).
I paused it to make some baked oatmeal, which I had only just learned about earlier in the afternoon.
Once it was in the oven my mom and I went back to watching the movie.
I was very eager to try my baked oatmeal the whole time it was cooking.
It turned out pretty good.
My mom and I ended up turning off the movie as we were both tired and falling asleep.
Next I got ready for bed and then went right to sleep.
Didn’t go to bed at the best time tonight, but way￼ closer to my usual goal time at least.
