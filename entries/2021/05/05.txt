May 5, 2021 - Wednesday
In my first class today I did good at getting a bunch of work done.
My next class was graphic design and I had a certification test.
Before the test I spent the first half of class going through the practice tests.
Then when it came time to take the real test I did pretty good and passed it easily.
After that it was already lunch break time.
I hung out on my phone for a while before switching to watching a movie.
The movie I chose was “The Game” (1997).
I had to pause it in the middle to attend my last class of the day.
In that class I also did good at getting work done.
After school I went back to watching the movie.
Once I finished the movie I went out of my room and talked with my uncle Oscar for a bit.
Then I went back to my room and just hung out on my phone pretty much all the way until dinner.
For dinner my uncle made chicken wings and baked potatoes.
Following dinner I ended up getting distracted working on my 3DS messing around with installing a program.
After I finished what I was working on I got ready for bed and then went to sleep a bit passed my target time.
