May 6, 2021 - Thursday
School today was pretty easy.
In art I colored in my drawing of a lily that I recreated from Da Vinci.
After school I ate a sandwich which my aunt Annette had made for me.
Following that I put sone more games on my 3DS and then played them for a while until it was time for me to go.
I had my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine scheduled for today.
After I got to the drug store I filled my car up with gas down the road.
Then I went back to the drug store and checked in.
I waited much less time than I did the first time and was out of there pretty quick.
Next I went to Hobby Lobby to look for something to hang a frog charm, which my friend Sherry gave to me last Sunday, from my car rear view mirror.
I found some rope type string for necklaces that I thought could maybe work, but after asking one of the cashiers about it she reccomened me to look in another area of the store.
In that area I ended up finding a black metal chain necklace thing that was perfect.
After buying it I went back to my car and got the frog hung up.
Then I stopped at Walmart to grab some frozen halibut.
Once I got back home I played on my 3DS a bit more.
Then I moved to working on modifying another aspect of it.
In the middle of working on that dinner was finished.
So I took a pause to have the chicken, corn, and yellow rice that my aunt made for dinner.
Following dinner I finished working on my 3DS.
Then I got ready for bed.
After that I got out my computer and played some games and talked on the phone with Sherry.
Once we got off I did pretty good at going right to bed.
