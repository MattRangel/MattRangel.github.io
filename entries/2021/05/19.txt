May 19, 2021 - Wednesday
School was pretty easy today again.
The days are getting easier and the end of school is in sight.
For lunch my aunt Annette made me a panini and then a pastry.
Following school I watched the movie “The Machinist” (2004).
After the movie I went outside and pogo sticked for a bit until I was tired.
Then I came back inside and just hung out on my phone for a while.
I started watching an episode of “Castlevania” (2017).
In the middle of that dinner was delivered.
For my dinner I chose a pork gyro and some sweet potato fries.
I also ordered rice pudding for my dessert.
I only ate my gyro and half the fries, so I’ll have some nice food for lunch tomorrow.
Following dinner I went back to my room and finished the “Castlevania” episode I was on.
Then I brushed my teeth and got ready for bed.
Next I went outside and cut my finger nails.
Coming back inside I watched one more episode of “Castlevania” before going to sleep right on time.
I ended up not being able to fall asleep though, because I had a rash and the itchiness kept me awake.
I tried to fall asleep a couple times, but I ended up giving up and deciding to just not sleep.
