May 26, 2021 - Wednesday
Today was an easy and short day of school.
I started off the morning just watching YouTube videos while I sat through my classes.
Later on in the school day I made some good progress on getting ahead in one of the last classes I still have work in.
After school I reheated some of the chicken and rice from last night for my lunch.
Once I finished eating I got dressed and went out.
My mission for today was to look at shirts and belts.
I ended up going to seven different thrift stores in total.
All of them didnâ€™t really have anything that interested me though.
Once I got back home I had a bowl of cereal and a slice of key lime pie.
Then I went to my room and just hung out until it was time for dinner.
For dinner we ordered greek delivery.
I chose a beeft gyro, which I only have three quarters of since I was still kind of full.
Next I went back to my room until it started getting close to time for bed.
So I got up and got ready for bed abd took a shower.
After that I had a tiny bit of time left for bed, so I just hung out on my phone for a bit more.
I also ended up calling with my mom for a bit and talking with her before I went to sleep.
