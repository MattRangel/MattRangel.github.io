May 15, 2021 - Saturday
Today was a pretty chill hang out day.
After getting out of bed and brushing my teeth I went and sat in the living room.
There I put on the movie “Once Upon a Time in the West” (1968).
While I was watching that my aunt Annette made me some scrambled eggs and a muffin for breakfast.
I ended up having to finish watching the movie on my phone, because the WiFi was acting up.
After finishing the movie I called my mom and talked with her for a bit.
watched another one called “The Raid” (2011).
While I was watching that my aunt and uncle Oscar came back home from work.
I also made myself some popcorn.
Later on my uncle’s sister came over and brought pastries.
Once I finished the movie I put on yet another one called “Paprika” (2006).
Once I finished that movie I went outside and pogo sticked for a tiny bit.
Coming back inside I layed down on my bed and watched YouTube for a bit until dinner was delivered.
For dinner I had some mongolian beef and white rice.
Then I cut my toe nails, took a shower, and got ready for bed.
Next I worked on the pass back and forth book that my friend Sherry and I have.
After that I was going to go to bed, but my aunt invited me to watch a movie so I stayed up for that.
The movie we all watched was called “The Woman in the Window” (2021).
Following the movie I went to sleep.
My bed time tonight was a little late, but better than yesterday which is good.
