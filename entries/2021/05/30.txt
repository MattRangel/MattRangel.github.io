May 30, 2021 - Sunday
I was a bit tired from being up so late last night, so today was mostly just a hang out day.
I wasn’t really in the mood to watch a movie, so I spent pretty much the whole day just chatting with friends and watching videos on my phone.
For breakfast my uncle Oscar made modified eggs benedict with gravy and ground meat.
Later in the afternoon I took a break from my phone and pogo sticked for a bit.
Then I came inside and ate the rest of raspberries I bought with my friend Sherry yesterday.
For dinner we had rice, black beans, shreaded meat, and corn bread.
During dinner I watched the movie “Those Who Wish Me Dead” (2021) with my aunt Annette.
Following the movie I went back to my room for a bit before getting ready for bed and taking a shower.
Even though I don’t have school tomorrow I still went to bed right on time, so now I can get any extra sleep I need and get back on my proper schedule.
