May 24, 2021 - Monday
During school this morning I watched the movie “Nothing Bad Can Happen” (2013).
After that only work I did in school today was to get ahead in another class.
Following school I ate the panini my aunt Annette made me for lunch.
Then I went to my room and hung out on my phone for a bit.
Later on I watched another movie called “Pierrot le Fou” (1965).
After the movie I went back to hanging out on my phone, but not for long because I got exhausted of that quickly.
So to get up and do sometime I decided to drive to a couple thrift stores near by to look at tshirts.
The first thrift store I drove to I couldn’t even find once I got there, because the shut down it looked like.
Then I went to another one which had all the clothes nicely￼ organized, but nothing that caught my eye.
There weren’t any other thrift stores near by, so after that I headed back home.
Once I got home dinner had already been finished so I ate right away.
For dinner there was chicken, corn on the cob, rice, and black beans.
Following dinner I went to my room amd watched the movie “Raise the Red Lantern” (1991).
After finishing the movie I took a shower and got ready for bed.
I went to bed a little bit passed my target time tonight, which isn’t good for trying to get used to sleeping at an already later time.
