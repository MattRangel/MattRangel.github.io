May 31, 2021 - Monday
I slept in pretty late this morning, and once I was awake I didn’t get up out of bed until even later.
I had the day off from school today for Memorial Day.
For breakfast I had a slice of a pastry and a bagle with cream cheese.
While I ate I watched some YouTube on TV with my uncle Oscar.
After that I went to my room where I hung out for the rest of the morning and into the afternoon.
Later on I went to Target to get a travel container for my face lotion.
I also got some things for my aunt Annette as well as a small pack of Hi-Chews.
Once I got back home I went back to hanging out in my room.
Then I took a break from my phone and cleared out my backpack, so I’d be able to use it for my trip to Iowa this weekend.
After clearing my backpack I organized the top of my dresser.
Next I went back to watching YouTube and had a bowl of cereal.
Then I went back to my room again until dinner was ready.
For dinner my uncle made steak, grilled vegetables, baked potatoes, and corn.
While we all ate I watched a couple episodes of “Money Hesit” (2017) with my aunt.
After that I went back to hanging out on my phone until it was time to get ready for bed.
I did fine at getting ready for bed and going to sleep on time tonight.
