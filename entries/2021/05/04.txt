May 4, 2021 - Tuesday
School today was pretty easy and didn’t drag on too long.
After school I reheated and ate the rest of the lasagna in the fridge.
I also talked on my phone with my mom a little this morning.
Next I was going to watch a movie, but the service I use wasn’t working.
Instead I just hung out on my phone for a while.
Then I had an apple before trying to watch the movie again.
This time it worked and I watched the movie “Mysterious Skin” (2004).
Following the movie I just hung out on my phone some more.
For dinner my aunt made rice and beans and reheated some shreaded pork.
After dinner I went back to hanging out on my phone for a bit.
Then I took a shower and got ready for bed.
I was going to play on the computer with my friend Sherry, but she ended up being too tired.
Instead I ended up reading my book “The Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett”.
Since I was already ready for bed all I had to do once it was time for bed was write this up.
I did good at not getting distracted and went to sleep right on time.
