After getting up this morning I went out to the kitchen and tried one of the brownies my aunt Annette had made last night.
Then I just hung out and watched YouTube for a while.
For breakfast my aunt made scrambled eggs, bacon, and some biscuts.
Then I went back to my room and just hung out on my phone for a while.
I texted with my friend Sherry, who said she wouldn’t be able to hang out again today.
Later on I shifted to watching a movie called “Higher Learning” (1995).
While I watched the start of the movie I had some cereal for lunch.
Following the movie I looked at language learning things on the internet.
Nothing that I’m actually going to stick with more just for fun.
Then I watched documentary called “The Killing of America” (1981).
In the middle of the movie my uncle Oscar finished cooking dinner, so I paused it to eat the frito pie he made.
Following dinner I went back to my room and finished the movie.
I stayed up a bit more after that just scrolling through my phone.
After I got ready for bed I talked with my mom on the phone for a while.
I didn’t go to bed at the best time, but it wasn’t super late so I’m still content.
As I was waiting to fall asleep my mom called me back and I spoke with her for a bit.
