I didn’t really have much work to do in school today again.
I think the teachers are slowing down now that it’s getting closer to the end of the year.
After school I made myself a croissant and beef stew sandwich, which is the same thing I had yesterday.￼
After eating I went to my room and hung out on my phone for a bit.
I kept checking the delivery status of the new WiFi card I ordered for my laptop.
While I was still waiting I decided to open my computer anyways, so that way I’d be ready when it came.
After opening it up there was a bunch of dust in the fan.
So I took it into the garage and cleaned it with my uncle Oscar using his air pressure tank.
Then I brushed it some more with rubbing alcohol and a toothbrush before putting it back in my computer.
My part still hadn’t arrived by the time I finished, so I was back to waiting.
My mom called me and I talked with her for a bit about technical problems she was having.
Once my part finally came in the mail I found a small screw driver to take out the old one and then put in the new one.
After that I put my computer back together and tested it out.
It was very satisfying seeing it immediately work.
Then I tested it for a bit and was very pleased with how much of an improvement it made.
After I finished I was playing around on it when the power went out.
Since I was low battery I had to stop playing on it.
The power ended up staying off for a good chunk of time.
While it was out I listened to some music and read my book “The Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett”.
Once the power came back on I got back on my computer and played Minecraft for the rest of the night.
I got off when it was time for me to and went to bed at a very good time.
