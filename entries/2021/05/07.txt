May 7, 2021 - Friday
Didn’t have much to do in my classes today which made for a pretty easy school day.
During the morning I researched getting a new WiFi card for my laptop.
Replacing it wouldn’t be too difficult, so after finding a good upgrade I placed the order.
For lunch I had a bowl of cereal and then a sandwich.
After lunch I went back to my room and played on my 3DS.
I ended up forgetting that I still had one class left and joined an hour late.
After school I played on my 3DS some more.
Then I called with my mom and showed her the drawing I made in art and the frog I hung up in my car.
Later on I went back outside to grab my pogo stick out of my car.
Before taking it back inside I jumped on it for a bit.
Coming back inside I sat down on the couch with my 3DS.
I also texted with my friend Sherry and we set up to meet tomorrow.
For dinner my aunt Annette ordered chinese food.
After the delivery person dropped off the food I had my meal.
I didn’t wait for my uncle and aunt, because they were still hadn’t even left work.
The thing I ordered had slimy vegetables, but besides that it was alright.
After eating I talked on the phone with my brother for a while.
I also said hello to my dad who was in the car with him.
After getting off the phone with my brother I hung out on my phone some before getting ready for bed and taking a shower.
Next I hung out on my phone some more until it got late.
I didn’t go to sleep at the best time tonight, but I’m not waking up super early so it’s no big deal.
