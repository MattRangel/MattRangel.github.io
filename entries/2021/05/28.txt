May 28, 2021 - Friday
Today was another school day of just sitting through my classes waiting for them to be over.
Besides just hanging out on my phone I also watched the movie “Kaboom” (2010).
After finishing school for the day I cleared off everything from my school laptop in order to return it.
Then I ate the panini my aunt Annette made me for lunch.
Next I got my school books and computer and headed over to my school to return them.
Following that I met this guy off the internet at a Publix to buy a tshirt off him.
Once I gpt back home I layed down in bed on my phobe for a bit and talked on the phone with my mom.
Then I put my bedding and the tshirt in the washing machine.
Next I shaved and then went back to hanging out until dinner was ready.
For dinner we had turkey burgers for burger day and fries.
After finishing dinner I had a slice of key lime pie.
Then I watched an episode of “Money Heist” (2017) with my aunt.
Following that I got ready for bed, took a shower, and cut my nails.
There was still quite a while before I had to actually got to bed, so I stayed up and watched YouTube for a while.
Later on my mom also called with me again.
I didn’t go to bed right on time tonight, but it’s no worries.
