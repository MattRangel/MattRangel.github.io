May 20, 2021 - Thursday
I didn’t really sleep at all tonight, so my day started very early.
I got a rash from something and so that’s why I couldn’t fall asleep.
I also think I’ve been going to bed too early, so I’m shifting my bed time to a later time.
Before my school day started I watched the movie “Menace II Society” (1993).
I had to pause the movie to brush my teeth, and then right as the movie ended it was time for school.
There wasn’t too much work for me today besides drawing a little picture.
After school I had my sweet potatoe fries from yesterday for lunch along with the rice pudding.
Then I just hung out on my phone for a good while.
I shifted to working on making another CD for my friend Sherry.
After finishing the CD I went outside and pogo sticked until I was fatigued.
Coming back inside I just hung out on my phone until it was time for dinner.
I also helped my uncle Oscar activate his new phone.
For dinner tonight we had yellow fish, rice, and stuffing.
Following dinner I took a shower and got ready for bed.
After that I still had a bit of time until it was time to go to sleep.
So I watched an episode of “Castlevania” (2017) and played on my phone for a bit.
Just before going to sleep right on time I watched one more episode of “Castlevania”.
Luckily I’m pretty tired, so I don’t think I’ll have trouble falling asleep like last night.
