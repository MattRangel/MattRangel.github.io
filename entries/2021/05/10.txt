May 10, 2021 - Monday
Pretty tired waking up this morning, but thankfully I didn’t really have to do anything in any of my classes.
During school I started watching the movie “The House That Jack Built” (2018).
After school for lunch I made myself a sandwich using a croissant￼ and some beef stew.
Once I finished eating lunch I went back to my room and finished watching the rest of the movie.
Next I just hung out on my phone for a bit.
I didn’t want to just do that for the rest of the day, so I watched some youtube and then chose another movie.
The next movie I watched was called “Farewell My Concubine” (1993).
Towards the end of that movie dinner was finished, so I took a quick pause to eat.
For dinner we had ribs, stuffing, and mashed potatoes.
The ribs were from my uncle Juan, who I saw yesterday.
After eating I went back to my room and finished the movie.
Then I hung out on my phone for a bit.
I got ready for bed and took a shower at a good time tonight and didn’t go to bed very late at all.
