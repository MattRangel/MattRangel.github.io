May 11, 2021 - Tuesday
Today in school I only really had any work to do in my first class.
I was able to get ahead in there too, which will be nice.
During my lunch break I had a panini that my aunt Annette made for me.
I also had a pastry and a bowl of cereal.
While I ate I started watching the movie “Aguirre, the Wrath of God” (1972).
I had to pause the movie to attend my last class of the day.
Then after class was over I finished the movie.
Next I just hung out on my phone for a while.
For dinner we had tacos.
Following dinner I watched the movie “Perfect Blue” (1997).
After finishing the movie I got ready for bed.
I was able to finish at a good time, but I ended up getting distracted on my phone.
So I didn’t go to bed at such a good time tonight.
