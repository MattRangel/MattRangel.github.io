My friend Sherry and I were maybe going to hang out today, but she ended up not being able to.
I was still pretty exhausted too anyways.
I just hung out on my phone for the beginning of the morning.
After I actually got up out of bed and brushed my teeth I went and sat in the living room and had an orange.
I was waiting for breakfast, but it was taking a while, so I went back to my room.
In there I called up my grandma to wish her a happy birthday.
Then I started watching the movie “Oldboy” (2003).
I had only just barely started it when breakfast was finished.
For breakfast we had biscuits, scrambled eggs, bacon, grits, and a pastry.
Then I went back to my room to keep watching the movie.
Finishing the movie took a bit longer than it should’ve, because I got distracted a couple times talking to my mom and to Sherry.
After I finally finished the movie I went to Target to look for some jeans.
I ended up finding two pairs that I liked.
Once I got back home I tried them on and I liked how they fit, which didn’t suprise me because they’re the same size as the ones I already have.
Then I called my mom again and told that they fitted good.
Next I folded my laundry, which went much faster this time since I thought up a new technique.
After folding I started watching the movie “Good Bye Lenin!” (2003).
I was half way through that movie when dinner was finished.
For dinner we had open tacos.
After dinner I went back to my room and finished the movie.
Then I got ready for bed and took a shower.
Went to bed right on time afterwards.
