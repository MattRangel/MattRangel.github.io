May 25, 2021 - Tuesday
Today was another school day of working ahead.
For lunch I had a panini, which my aunt Annette made for me.
I kept watching the movie “Raw” (2016), which I had started in my class before lunch.
After eating lunch I went back to my room and kept watching the movie.
I paused the movie to get a little more work done ahead in class.
Then I finished it a little after I finished school.
Next I hung out on my phone for a bit.
Not for too long though, because I planned some things to do so I wouldn’t waste my whole day away.
Before getting started on my plans I had an apple.
Then I went outside and washed the cooler I had bought from when I worked at the thrift store.
After drying it off and putting it back into the car I came back to my room.
In there I cleanned up some things and cleared off my dresser a bit.
Next I tried on my two new pairs of jeans to see how they’d look with my flame shirt.
After I was done dressing up I layed down and listened to music for a bit.
Later on I got up and had a bowl of cereal.
Then I came back into my room and watched another movie called “The Net” (2016).
After the movie finished I got ready for bed and went to sleep.
Tonight I went to bed right on time.
