May 17, 2021 - Monday
I had work to do all throughout my first class of the day and my last one.
Both of those classes I’m doing work in are to get further ahead.
During my other classes I just played games on my phone and watched YouTube videos.
For lunch my aunt made me a melt sandwich.
After my last class of the day I watched a movie and ate some more.
The movie I watched was “Straw Dogs” (1971).
While I watched I had a bowl of cereal.
After finishing the movie I went outside and pogo sticked for a bit until I was tired.
Then I came back inside and hung out on my phone for a while.
Later on I got on my computer and played Minecraft for a bit.
For dinner we had beef stew, rice, and corn bread.
Following dinner I hung out in my room for a tiny bit before taking a shower and brushing my teeth.
Next I put away my computer and hung out until it was time for bed.
I did very good at going to bed right on time tonight.
