May 21, 2021 - Friday
I woke up in the middle of the night this morning and was worried I wouldn’t be able to sleep again, but luckily I fell right back asleep.
After waking up for real I got my teeth brushed and started my school day.
Today I got far ahead in the first class.
During one of my classes my dad called me and we talked about different things for a while.
For lunch my aunt Annette made me a panini.
Then I went back on my computer for my last class of the day.
I’m only a little ahead in that class, so I had to do a little work to stay ahead.
Following school I would’ve prefered to watch a movie, but instead I just spent the day hanging out on my phone.
I took a break and sat in the living room to eat an orange and a banana.
While I was out there I chatted with my aunt and uncle Oscar.
Then I went back to my room until it was time for dinner.
For dinner we had shredded beef, rice, avacado, and some bread.
Following dinner I was in my room for a bit and then my aunt asked if I’d like to watch a movie.
So I came out and watched the movie “Above Suspicion” (2019).
After the movie I took a shower and got ready for bed.
Then I went to sleep on a little passed my target time, which I’ll make up for by sleeping in a little tomorrow.
