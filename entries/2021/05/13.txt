Today was another school day of not having too much work to do.
The period I usually have lunch before was a little off schedule, because we had a sub during that class.
I still managed to get lunch during class though.
For my lunch I made myself a sandwich and had some rasins and a pastry along side that.
Following lunch I went back to my room for my last class of the day.
I’m already ahead in that class, so I didn’t really do anything.
After school I watched the movie “Three Colors: Blue” (1993).
Then I watched the second movie of that trilogy, which is called “Three Colors: White” (1994).
During that movie the dinner my uncle Oscar ordered was ￼delivered.
For dinner we had beef and cheese sandwiches along with some fries.
Following dinner I went back to my room and finished the movie.
Next I got ready for bed and took a shower.
Then I got on my computer and played Roblox with my friend Sherry for the rest of the night.
I went to bed a little late tonight, but nothing really terrible.
