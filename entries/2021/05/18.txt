This morning I texted with my friend Sherry to ask her what her parents said about our idea to go on a road trip together.
Her parents said no, which wasn’t super suprising, but it was still fun to think about it.
After finishing school I reheated some stew, rice, abd a biscuit for lunch.
Following lunch I watched the movie “Mr. Thank You” (1936).
I didn’t really super care for the movie, but I finished it anyways.
Following the movie I went outside and pogo sticked for a bit.
Then I came back inside and went on my computer to play Minecraft.
Next I watched the TV show “Castlevania” (2017) until it was time for dinner.
For dinner we had chili dogs.
After eating I got ready for bed.
Then I played Minecraft with Sherry until it was pretty much time for me to go to sleep.
Before going to sleep I finished watching an episode of “Castlevania”.
I went to bed right on time tonight.
