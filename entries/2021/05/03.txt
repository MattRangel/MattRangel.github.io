May 3, 2021 - Monday
Before school started this morning I put my camera’s memory card into my computer and sent the photos I took yesterday to my phone.
Next I texted them to my friend Sherry.
She texted me back some photos she had on her phone.
Then we planned our next meet up to go out to a planetarium laser light show.￼
During my first few classes of the day I didn’t really have any work to do, so I worked on editing the photos I took with Sherry yesterday to post on to my Instagram.
Once I finished that I found a caption by looking through my book “Tao Te Ching” by “Lao Tzu”.
Then I just hung out on my phone until it was my lunch break.
For lunch my uncle Oscar gave me his lasagna, which I reheated in the microwave.
To drink I had some of the coconut water that I had bought yesterday.
After eating I spent the rest of my lunch break talking on the phone with my grandma.
During my last class of the day I worked on getting ahead in another class.
After school had ended I kept working for a bit more until I finished the lesson I was on.
Next I went in the living room and sat on the couch while I drank the rest of my coconut water.
Then I went back to my room and watched the movie “The Dance of Reality” (2013).
In the middle of the movie I paused to eat dinner.
For dinner my uncle reheated some stew, rice, and made some corn bread.
Following dinner I went back to my room and finished my movie.
Right as I finished the movie Sherry texted me back saying she could play Minecraft.
So for the rest of the night I played Minecraft with her and talked on the phone.
Once it started to get late she had to eat dinner and I had to go to bed.
After getting ready for bed I ended up staying up a bit more.
Staying up that extra amount put me going to bed quite a bit later than I would have otherwise.
