May 27, 2021 - Thursday
Starting off my school day this morning I didnâ€™t really do much at all besides hang out on my phone.
Later on I finished working ahead in one of my classes.
The other school work I had was a short english assignment and a computer science packet.
For lunch I had the rest of my gyro from last night and then some left over chicken and rice from the other day.
While I ate I texted with my friend Sherry and planned to meet up on Saturday.
After finishing school I stayed on my computer a bit longer to finish all of the packet I had for computer science. 
Then I just continued hanging out on my phone for the rest of the day pretty much.
I took a break from my phone and went outside to play footbag at one point.
After coming back inside I had an apple then went back to my room until it was time for dinner.
For dinner my uncle Oscar made cut up steak and cabbage.
Following dinner I went back to my room again.
I came back out to eat a granola bar at one point.
I did good at getting ready for bed and taking a shower at a good time.
There was still a bot of time before bed, so I stayed up and watched YouTube.
I also got a message back from a guy on the internet I was asking about buying a shirt from.
Tonight I went to bed right on time.
