January 24, 2020 - Sunday
I was pretty tired after waking up this morning, so I stayed in bed for a little bit before actually getting up.
After I brushed my teeth I came back to my room and started getting rid of trash.
While I was getting rid of things I also started packing my things into boxes since I’m going to be moving to Florida in a few days.
I kept packing all the way until my dad finished making lunch.
The lunch that he made was shrimp pasta.
Following lunch I got back to work in my room.
Shortly after I startred I stopped again to watch a movie with my mom.
The movie we watched was called “The Basketball Diaries” (1995).
Soon after the movie was done my dad called for me and asked me to help him work outside in the shed.
The weather wasn’t that great, so we ended up coming back inside after a while.
Right after I came back inside my mom was getting ready to take my brother to church class.
So I changed my clothes and rode along with her.
After we dropped off my brither we decided to just come back home, because I still had more work to do on my room and didn’t want to stay out too late.
Once we got home I got right back to work packing away my room.
I didn’t stop until I had packed pretty much verything I planned to bring with me.
Then I ate some grapes and marshmallows before brushing my teeth.
After that I washes the dishes.
Lastly I finished getting ready for bed and then went to sleep.
I didn’t go to bed at a good time at all tonight, but I’m hoping I’ll be able to rest this afternoon after I run some errands in the morning.
