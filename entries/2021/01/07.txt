January 7, 2020 - Thursday
My school day today took a while longer than usual due to two of my classes.
Those two classes took so long because I had to install software onto my computer to do the work for both of them.
After my school day was over I just hung out for a while.
Then I ate some fruit and a miracle berry that my grandma gave me.
Following that I was going to watch a movie but as I was watching it I got really tired, so I decided to take a nap instead.
Shortly after I woke up I took a shower and then ate the dinner my grandma made for me.
After dinner I read for a while and then headed home.
Once I got home I got started on getting ready for bed right away just a little bit slowly.
I went to bed on time once again tonight.
I think the reason I was tired even though I’ve been going to bed on time lately is because I haven’t been tired enough to fall asleep right when I go to bed.
