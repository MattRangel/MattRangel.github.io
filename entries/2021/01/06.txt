January 6, 2021 - Wednesday
Today was my first day back to school in 2021.
I was able to get back into my working zone pretty easily and finished up all my work for the day shortly after lunch.
Then I watched the movie “Repo Man” (1984), which ended up being a much different type of movie than I expected.
Following that movie I looked through my watchlist for another one.
I ended up watching “The Fool” (2014), finishing it as I ate my dinner.
After dinner I finished working on my computer for my dad and then headed home.
Once I got home I helped my dad print something.
Then I brushed my teeth and washed the dishe.
Next I finished getting ready for bed.
I talked with my mom about things she learned after calling my soon to be new school.
I went to bed right on time once again tonight, although with little time to spare.
