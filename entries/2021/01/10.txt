January 10, 2020 - Sunday
After waking up this morning I looked outside to see if it ended up snowing like the weather said it was going to when I looked yesterday.
What I saw was my entire backyard white with snow.
I went outside and took a photo then came back inside to brush my teeth.
Next I came back to my room where I practiced Hindi for a little bit and then read for a while.
For my lunch I just had a can of SpaghettiOs, because it was one of the easiest things I could find.
Following lunch I went outside to play in the snow woth my brother.
After I found him we came back to the house quickly, so he could switch shoes and I could grab bags for us to tie around our feet so we wouldn’t get too wet.
We snowball fought for a little while and then we worked on building a snow man.
Shortly after we finished the snowman we came back inside.
Then I came back to my room where I went back to reading until it was time for dinner checking my phone every once in a while.
For dinner my dad made yellow rice and yucca.
After dinner I cut myself a slice of watermelon and then a slice of apple pie for dessert.
Next I watched a movie called “The Professor and the Madman” (2019).
Following the movie I washed the dishes, got ready for bed, and cleaned my room.
Before going to bed I wrote up this entry and practiced Hindi for a little bit, but not too long because it was already late.
I went to bed a bit passed my target time tonight, but I’ll be able to sleep in since my school for tomorrow was cancelled because of the snow.
