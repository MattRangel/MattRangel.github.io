January 29, 2021 - Friday
This morning after I woke up my dad came in to make sure I was awake.
Then I got ready for the day.
Later on we cleared out the back of the car and put in some equipment.
We were going to transfer my driver’s license, but the DMV was only open to local people.
So we went back to the house we’ve been staying.
Then we went to my new school in order to enroll me.
Then my dad and I went and got lunch.
I got a BBQ sauce chicken pizaa.
Next we headed over to the new house and ate our lunch.
Today we cleared out some of the rooms and stripped some off the old paint.
My uncle and dad had to go to the hardware store, so I drove my car back to the house.
Then I ate dinner with my aunt and chatted with her until my dad and uncle got back.
They sat with us and ate dinner and we all watched some TV.
After finishing his dinner my uncle showed me some of the cool stuff he has.
Then I just hung out with everyone for the rest of the night.
I ended up staying up quite a bit too late tonight.
