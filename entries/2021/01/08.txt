January 8, 2020 - Friday
My school day for today was pretty short and easy.
The thing that took me the longest was a history assignment that my teacher posted a day late, otherwise I would’ve done it yesterday.
I facetimed with my mom to ask her to take a photo of my book at home for me for a school warm up thing, because I forgot to do so myself last night.
Following my school day I just hung out for a bit before eating lunch shortly afterwards.
After lunch I facetimed with my friend Erin for pretty much the rest of the day.
We took a pause so she could eat dinner though, so while she did that I ate a snack and hung out for a bit until she called me back.
During our pause I also called my mom to tell her about the email I got back about my school transcripts.
My mom needed my transcripts to send to my soon to be new school.
I eventually had to get off the phone with Erin once it was time for me to eat dinner.
Erin and I have know each other for a while now, but we’ve recently started talking more, and after calling with her today for the first time in quite a while I think we’ll continue talking more often.
After I took a shower and ate I packed up my things and headed home.
Once I got home I looked at computer bags for myself with my dad.
I wasn’t really able to find one very quickly, and I was looking the other day and wasn’t happy with any of the ones I found that day.
So I knew it’d take a while to find one suited for me, so I switched gears to watching a movie with my mom like we planned earlier in the day.
We started off watching the movie my mom had texted me about earlier, but I was not really feeling in the mood to watch that type of movie.
So we agreed to switch the movie to “Unknown” (2011).
Following the movie I got ready for bed and shaved.
I stayed up a little bit late tonight reading before going to sleep.
Tonight’s staying up was a controlled lateness though, so I think it’s okay.
