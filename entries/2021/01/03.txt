January 3, 2021 - Sunday
My breakfast this morning was reheated rice and beans.
Then I watched the movie “Boyz n da Hood” (1991) with my mom.
After that I just hung out for a while.
I helped my mom install excell on her fomputer and then went back to my room.
Later on my dad called for me to help him work on putting back together a zero turn with him.
We came back inside so he could get a few more things started for dinner.
When he went back outside to work he asked me to watch the food on the stove for him.
Once I was done watching I went back to my room until the food was all finished.
My dad made eggs, rice, and lintil beans.
Following dinner I watched the movie “Hereditary” (2018) and ate ice cream.
After the movie I washed the dishes and got ready for bed.
I didn’t go to bed right afterwards though which I should’ve.
What messed me up I think is that when I finished getting ready for bed it was already late and passed my target time.
That messed with my motivation and I ended up staying up even later.
