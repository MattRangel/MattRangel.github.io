January 5, 2021 - Tuesday
This morning I tried some peach marshmallows that my mom got with my mom and brother.
Then my brother and I headed over to my grandparents’ house for the day.
For lunch today we had chicken, bean, rice, and cheese tacos.
Following lunch I didn’t do too much for a while.
Later on though I watched the movie “As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me” (2001).
After the movie I just hung out for a bit before taking a shower and eating my dinner.
For dinner today I had the pizza and soup that was left over from yesterday.
Then I worked on my computer for my dad for a bit before heading back home.
Once I got home I did good and getting started on the dishes right away.
Except I did take a while to find a video to put on while I did them.
I ended up choosing a short documentary.
After I finished up getting ready for bed I went to my room and just hung out for the last little bit of my night.
I did good at going to bed on time again tonight, which is good since I’m going back to school and getting off winter break tomorrow.
