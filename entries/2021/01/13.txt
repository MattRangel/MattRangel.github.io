Today I did good at not getting distracted from my school work until I was all the way done for the day.
After that I practiced Hindi for a little bit.
Next I read my book “The Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett” for a good while.
I took a break from reading and watched the movie “Scum” (1979).
At the very beginning of the movie I ate some grapes as a snack.
Folllowing the movie I was reading some more when my grandma asked me to get some pizza for dinner.
So I drove to Pizza Hut and ordered a stuffed crust half pepperoni half hawaiian pizza.
While I was waiting for the pizza I got some gas for my car.
Then once the pizza was done I went back to my grandparents’ house.
Once I got back I took a shower and then ate.
Next I hung out on my phone for a bit before heading home.
At home I didn’t do too great at not getting distracted.
I took a while to get started on the dishes and then I took some more time to get started on getting ready for bed.
By the time I went to bed it was pretty late for me.
