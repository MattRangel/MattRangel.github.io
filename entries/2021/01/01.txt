January 1, 2021 - Friday
For breakfast this morning I had some tea and a pot pie.
Then I was going to watch a movie with my mom, but it took a really long time to find one and we both got distracted a bunch.
We finally ended up watching the movie “1917” (2019).
During the movie I reheated some of the pork, rice, and beans from yesterday for my lunch.
After we finished the movie my mom and I got in the car and went out to do a few things.
My brother was going to come, but he didn’t end up feeling like it.
First my mom and I went to church, so she could get a calendar.
Then we got some gas and went to go recycle some things.
After that we stopped by a comic book shop to look at their hours for my brother.
Next we stopped at a new pizza place to check it out and we got some desserts.
On our way home my dad called asking us to get some Bush’s Chicken.
Once we got back home I pulled up another movie for my mom and I to watch.
It took a while to get it to work, because my computer wasn’t set up properly since I had recently reset it.
The movie we watched was called “Escape from Alcatraz” (1979).
Following the movie I got ready for bed, but didn’t go to sleep until much later.
Tonight I went to bed much later than I have in a while.
I am going to need to stop procrastinating writing this up.
