January 12, 2021 - Tuesday
Throughout my school day today I took pauses to go on my phone.
Because of that my day took a bit longer than it would’ve normally.
I also had a bit more work than usual so that combined with my breaks led me to have a stretched out work day.
After finishing my school day I hung out on my phone for a bit.
Then I practiced Hindi for a little while.
Following that I spent the rest of my time up until dinner reading my book “The Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett”.
After dinner I read some more and ended up staying at my grandparents’ house reading a bit too late.
Once I got home I said hello to each of my faimly members and then got started on the dishes.
Next I brushed my teeth and went to bed.
Although I got home late I did good at not wasting a ton of time getting my nightly things done, so I was able to go to bed on time.
