January 27, 2021 - Wednesday
I fell asleep before writing this entry up and am now writing it a day late.
This morning I woke up the the voice of my parents talk.
Ince I was up I said goodbye to my brother who was getting ready to go to school.
Then I started packing my car with the boxes of my things I put togetger the other day.
My mom got home before I was finished and she helped me fit all my things in the car really good.
Then I said goodbye to my mom and we headed to my grandparents’ house.
We stayed there for a tiny bit before leaving.
My dad and I switched back and forth between driving.
For dinner we ate at a Cajun place.
I don’t know how long I slept for all together exactly, but I can say that it wasn’t enough.
