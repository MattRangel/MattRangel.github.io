Today I had exams in history and graphic design class.
I started off my school day working on exam reviews for graphic design.
Then I did some regular work for another class.
After that I wasn’t able to do anything else, since I couldn’t take my exams until a specific time later in the day.
So I played Roblox for a while and hung out on my phone until it was time for lunch.
Following lumch I took my two exams.
Then I played some more Roblox.
My mom called me telling me she got my shot records, which the school I’m transfering to in Florida needs in order for me to enroll.
For a little bit I also played Roblox with my two friends Tabby and Lucy.
After they got off I played a while more until it was dinner time.
Following dinner I read for a while,  and a bit later than I normally do.
Once I got home it was already kind of late.
Then I spent a bunch of time just sitting in my room letting it get even later.
I eventually got up and washed the dishes and got ready for bed, but by the time I finished it was very late for me.
Instead of going right to bed after that I got distracted again looking into how I will go about changing my ID and things to Floridian.
I for sure did not do good at not getting distracted tonight.
