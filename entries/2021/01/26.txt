January 26, 2021 - Tuesday
Waking up this morning I felt the effect of not going to bed on time so many nights in a row.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house after dropping my brother off at school I just layed down and rested for a while.
I also installed a few Microsoft programs onto my dad’s laptop.
Then I went to the store with him to buy groceries for my grandparents.
We had to go to two different stores, because the first one was missing a couple things.
Once I got back to my grandparents’ house I ate lunch.
Then I layed back down for a bit.
I looked for a movie to watch with my grandparents and ended up choosing “Uncle Buck” (1989).
Following the movie I played modded Minecraft with my friend Sherry for a while, until I got a phone call from my dad.
He wanted me to pick up my brother from school.
I ended up getting to the school a little early and my brother gound me in the line pretty quickly, so that all went good.
I waited outside of my grandparents’ house in the car with my brother while he waited for my dad to come and pick him up.
Then I went back to playing Minecraft with Sherry.
I took a pause to wash some grapes, so that my grandma would be able to pack them all for me later.
For dinner I had shrimp and rice.
Following dinner my grandma gave me some things to take on the trip to Florida with me.
Then I put all my things into my car and said goodbye to them.
I wasn’t sure whether or not I’d see them before I left for the trip.
Once I got home my mom helped me bring in some of the things I had in my car.
Inside I talked with my Dad about when he was wanting to leave and he said tomorrow morning.
Later on I watched the movie “Memento” (2000).
Following the movie it was already pretty late, so I got permission to do the dishes tomrrow instead.
Then I just got all ready for bed abd wrote this entry up.
I didn’t do the best at going to sleep on time tonight again, but it was slightly better than some of these previous days.
