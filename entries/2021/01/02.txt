January 2, 2021 - Saturday
For my breakfast this morning I had toast and reheated some rice and beans.
Then I went back to my room and watched videos about the Killdozer for a while until my dad called for my brother and I.
He need our help working outside.
So I went out there and helped him apply a sticker and then put back together a zero turn.
We took a break once it became time to leave to have dinner with my grandparents.
For dinner my dad planned to cook crab, shrimp, corn, potatoes, and sweet potatoes.
Before going to my grandparents’ house we stopped at HEB to get the ingredients.
Then we went to my grandparents’ house where he cooked everything.
While he cooked I sat with my mom on the couch and we looked at food containers on amazon.
After we ate dinner we went to Walmart to get some ice cream for dessert.
I chose a pint of vanilla and also some ice cream bars for us all to share.
I ate one of the bars on the drive home and decided to leave my ice cream for tomorrow.
Once I got home I brought things from the car inside.
Then I started getting ready for bed.
Although I did things inbetween I did good at getting all my nightly tasks done before it was time for me to go to sleep.
Tonight I went to bed right on time.
