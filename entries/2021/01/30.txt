January 30, 2021 - Saturday
Aftrr getting up out of bed I went and hung out in the living room.
My uncle Oscar let me shoot his pellet gun.
He also put on some YouTube videos of hobbies he likes.
Later on my dad, Oscar, and I all started getting ready to work on the house again.
Before going to the house we stopped at Oscar’s warehouse.
We helped there a tiny bit.
Then we stopped at Home Depot for a few things.
I stayed in the car to watch and make sure nothing was taken from the truck.
At the house I scraped at paint for a good while.
Later on Oscar’s sister brought some food, and then my aunt Annett brought some food for Oscar to make sandwiches.
After eating we all got back to work including Annett and Oscar’s sister.
Once it was time for me to go I left with Annett and we went to Publix.
Oscar’s sister also followed us there and we all went shopping together.
Getting back home took a while.
I took a shower and changed into pajamas quickly after getting home.
Then after Oscar got back home I helped him set up a few things on his iPad.
For dinner Annett ordered Hibachi.
I got steak and fried rice.
Also some soup which I ended up choosing to have tomorrow.
Following dinner Annett put on a movie she rented called “Come Play” (2020).
By the time the movie was over it was pretty late, but luckily I brushed my teeth earlier so I didn’t spend too much time on that.
I did go to bed late again tonight though.
