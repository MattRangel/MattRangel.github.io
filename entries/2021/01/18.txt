January 18, 2021 - Monday
Today I had the day off from school for Martin Luther King Jr. day.
I was pretty tired after waking up, so I hung out in bed on my phone for a while before getting up to brush my teeth.
Then I went back to my room and hung out until my dad called for me.
He needed my help working on my mom’s car in the shed.
I also drove him around to a couple auto parts shops.
Once we got back I helped him some more until I had to leave to go eat lunch at my grandparents’ house.
Just a little bit after I finished eating lunch at my grandparents’ house my dad needed my help with something else.
My grandparents’ roof was leaking and so he had to replace some wood and shingles.
That ended up taking up the rest of my afternoon as he had to cut out the bad area and replace it.
I ate the dinner my grandma made for me while my dad drove to the store to get different shingles.
Once he got back it was dark and so I had to go on the roof with him to shine a light.
I’m not too scared of heights, but being up there on the steep roof was a little unnerving.
After we covered up the wood we came down and cleaned up for the night.
Intook a shower then hung out for a little bit before heading home.
At home I didn’t do my best at starting the dishes right away.
I ended up not getting up to start them until after I was already up following helping my dad move his truck.
Following the dishes I got ready for bed, which also took a while as I kept getting distracted.
Then instead of writing this up and going to bed right away I stayed up way too late partially procrastinating and partially losing track of time getting distracted.
I’m definitely going to feel the effect of my staying up late tomorrow.
