January 31, 2021 - Sunday
After waking up this morning I watched YouTube on the TV with my dad and uncle Oscar for a bit.
Oscar also showed us some of his machinery in the garage.
For breakfast we had egg, grits, and bacon.
Following breakfast my dad told me to start getting dressed and ready to go work on the house.
Before I started getting dressed my dad told me I can instead just stay home for today if I wanted.
Happy to have a day off I agreed.
So I just hung out in the living room on my phone for a while.
Later on I went to Walmart with my aunt Annett.
We got some supplise to make ice cream.
Once we got back home I helped carry in groceries.
For dinner she made frito pie.
After we both ate dinner we made frozen yogurt, but it had to sit in the fridge first.
So after it was finally done chilling in the fridge we took it out and put it in the ice cream maker.
The ice cream turned out pretty good.
Once my dad and Oscar got back home from working on the house we all watched the a DVD that Annett rented called “Wander” (2020).
Following the movie I got ready for bed and then went to sleep.
I went to bed a little better tonight, but still stayed up late watching a movie again.
