January 15, 2021 - Friday
I didn’t have any school work to do today, because I finished it all ahead of time earlier in the week.
The majority of my day at my grandparents’ house I was just hanging out on my phone.
I was either scrolling through social media or chatting with friends mostly.
My plan to watch a movie never came to fruition, because I couldn’t find a movie I really felt like watching.
In the afternoon I took a pause from my phone and played Roblox with my friends Tabby and Lucy for a while.
Before leaving my grandparents’ house I helped my grandma pull up a church YouTube video.
On my way home my mom called me to tell me the family and her were at Dairy Queen and wanted to know if I wanted anything.
It was kind of late for ice cream and I wasn’t really hungry so I said no.
Once I got home I looked at one of the multiple cameras my mom said she would give to me.
The one I was looking at was a digital one, but earlier in the day I had talked to my friend about the film one that my mom had.
I was working on formatting and SD card and trying to get it to work on the camera for a while.
It turned out though that the SD card I had was too big for the old camera.
So I just backed up the photos on the smaller SD card to use that one.
Before I had a chance to take a photo the battery died, so I had to find the charger and plug it in.
Then I hung out on my phone for a while before moving on to getting ready for bed.
After brushing my teeth and shaving I went outside and cut my nails.
Next I finished up getting ready for bed.
Right before going to bed I practiced a little bit of Hindi in order to keep my streak going.
I went to bed a bit late tonight, but hopefully not so late that I sleep in a ton.
