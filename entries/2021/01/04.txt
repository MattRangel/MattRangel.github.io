January 4, 2021 - Monday
After waking up and brushing my teeth this morning I tried some marshmallows with my brother that my mom bought for us.
Then I took out all the trash in the house and got ready to go to my grandparents’ house.
After eating lunch I was planning on watching a movie, but I never ended up getting the motivation to put one on.
Later on my grandparents, brother, and I all got in the car to pick up some medicine and then get some ice cream.
The line at the drive through pharmacy took a while to go through.
Then we went across the street to Sonic and I got an Oreo ice cream shake.
After that my grandma ask me to drive to Little Caesars to get some pizza dinner.
Once I got the pizza I drove back to my grandparents’ house where I hung out for a bit more before taking a shower and eating dinner.
Following dinner I worked on my computer for my dad for a while before heading home.
I had to turn around on the way home, because I forgot to get gas and I didn’t want to pay a bunch at the smaller gas station.
Once I got home I did good at starting and finishing my nightly tasks before starting to hang out.
My going to bed time for tonight was right on schedule.
I was going to read a book some earlier at my grandparents’ house, but I never set aside the time.
For sure going to want to try and decrease the amount of time I’m just scrolling through my phone throughout the day.
