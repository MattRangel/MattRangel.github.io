January 19, 2021 - Tuesday
This morning I woke up pretty tired since I’ve been going to bed late these past few days.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house after dropping my brother off at school I checked their attic to make sure the repair my dad and I made worked and no rain was leaking.
Coming inside I pulled my classes up for the day on my school computer.
This week I am taking my exams for each class, so there wasn’t really any regular work that I had to do.
While I waited for my teach to post the exam I hung out on my phone and played Roblox on my computer.
The exam didn’t even end up getting posted until after I finished eating lunch.
After I finished the exam I played Minecraft with my friend Sherry for pretty much the rest of the afternoon.
We took a pause in the middle so I could drive to the gas station to buy some lottery tickets for my grandparents.
Once I got back I got back on Minecraft with Sherry until it was time for me to have dinner.
For dinner my grandma made shrip pasta with alfredo sauce.
Following dinner I didn’t stay too long at my grandparents’ house like I normally do.
Once I got home I was going to get started on the dishes right away, but I ended up getting distracted.
This distraction wasn’t my usual one though.
I was looking at the email my mom fowarded me about enrolling in my soon to be new school and it said I had to pick some of my classes.
So I sat in the office and decided on which classes I wanted.
Following that I got back on track and got ready for bed and washed the dishes.
I was slowed down a tiny bit by looking for YouTube videos while I washed the dishes.
I also got a littke distracted while writting this entry up.
Overall I didn’t do too bad at not getting distracted, but I still went to bed late since I took so long choosing classes.
