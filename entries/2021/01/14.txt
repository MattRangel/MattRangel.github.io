January 14, 2021 - Thursday
After getting to my grandparents’ house this morning I hung out before my school day started.
Once it did I checked into all my classes and did a few things and my school day was done shortly after it started.
Then I went back to hanging out on my phone for a but.
Next I read my book “The Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett” for a bit.
I took a break from reading and watched the movie “The King of Comedy” (1983).
Following the movie I repeated what I did earlier and went on my phone then read.
I also played Roblox with a new friend of mine named Tabby during that time.
After eating dinner I stayed at my grandparents’ house reading a bit later than normal.
I did better at not getting distracted than I did yesterday though, so coming home late didn’t mess me up too much.
After brushing my teeth I finished getting ready for bed.
Then I went on a walk with my mom for the first time in quite a while.
Before going to bed I practiced some hindi, because I didn’t practice any in the afternoon like I normally do.
I went to bed a little bit late tonight, but it was all good things I stayed up for so I’m happy.
