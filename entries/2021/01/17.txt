January 17, 2021 - Sunday
I was still pretty tired after waking up this morning because of how late I stayed up.
After I got out of bed I looked in the fridge for any leftovers I could heat up for breakfast.
There wasn’t any, so I instead ate a can of SpaghettiOs and a yogurt.
Then I went back to my room and played Roblox until my dad finished making lunch.
For lunch my dad made salmon, rice, potatoes, and lentils.
Right after lunch I washed the dishes.
Then I went outside to help my dad in the shed for almost the rest of the afternoon.
I also drove him to the auto parts shop so he could borrow a tool.
Once I finished helping my dad I took a shower and got dressed.
I went with my mom to drop my brother off at church class.
We went to the store and then went to Kristen and Audrey Shae’s house. (Family friends - Kristen is mom’s age and Aurey is mine)
We all four went to pick my brother up from church class.
Then we went to Sonic to get ice cream and celebrate Kristen’s birthday.
Next we all went to HEB to grab something for my dad.
After that we dropped Kristen and Audrey Shae back off at their house and headed home.
My brother played the music for the drive home.
Once I got home I took a little to get started on the dishes, but not too terribly long.
Luckily there weren’t too many dishes since I did most of them after lunch.
Next I sat with my mom and wrote this up.
Then I got ready for bed and cleaned my room before finally going to sleep.
I went to bed late again tonight, but luckily I don’t have school tomorrow so I’ll be able to sleep in some.
