January 28, 2021 - Thursday
This morning was pretty simmilar to my day yesterday.
We got to Florida and then with my uncle, my dad and I went to a clinic so I could get some papers to enroll in school.
I ended up waiting around for my turn for about two and a half hours.
Then I ate the sandwich that they had gotten for me earlier.
Them we went to the new house where we did various things fixing up the property.
By the time we finished it was already getting dark.
Once we got back I ate the beef stew, rice, and corn bread that my Aunt Annette made.
Then I took a shower and got ready fir bed.
I was to tired to even try abd stay up late tonight.
