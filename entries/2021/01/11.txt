January 11, 2021 - Monday
There was no school for my brother and I today, because of all the snow that came yesterday.
I slept in a bit later than I normally do.
Once I got up I brushed my teeth and then took out all the trash in the house.
By the time I finished it was already time for my brother and I to go over to my grandparents’ house.
Before leaving I had to push all the snow off my car.
At my grandparents’ house my grandma cooked gumbo and rice for lunch.
Following lunch I practiced Hindi for a bit.
I’m still working on the alphabet and pronunciations, but I am slowly figuring it out.
Then I read my book “The Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett” for a good while.
Next I finished watching the movie “Easy Rider” (1969), which I had started the very beginning of a few days ago.
By the time the movie was over it was time for dinner, so I took a shower and then ate.
For dinner my grandma made rosquitas.
After dinner I hung out on my phone for a while before heading home.
Once I got home I hung out on my phone a little more before getting started on the dishes.
Then I brushed my teeth and got ready for bed.
I went to bed at an alright time just a little bit passed my target.
Note: I just realized I wrote 2020 instead of 2021 for five days this year already! lol
