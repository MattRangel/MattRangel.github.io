January 21, 2021 - Thursday
My school day today was pretty short.
I had two exams in English and personal finance.
Both of them weren’t time locked, so I got them both done pretty quick after starting.
Shortly after finishing my school day my dad called me on the phone for me to come and help him run some errands.
First I followed him to the mechanic where he dropped off my mom’s car.
Then we both got in my car and went grocery shopping for my grandparents.
We went to HEB, but we also had to go to Walmart because there were a few things we were missing.
After shopping we went back to the mechanic for my dad to get the car back.
Then I drove back to my grandparents’ house and brought in the groceries.
Next I ate lunch.
Following lunch I played Minecraft with my friend Sherry for a little while.
After that I played Roblox with my friends Tabby and Lucy.
Once I got off my computer I read for a short bit before taking a shower and eating dinner.
I read some more before heading home after finishing dinner.
Once I got home I didn’t do too great at not getting distracted.
I ended up going to bed late again tonight.
