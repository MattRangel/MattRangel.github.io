July 15, 2021 - Thursday
Had an arepa with a fried egg on top for breakfast.
Then I hung out a while on the patio.
I did part of Juanda’s work out with him.
Later on I moved up stairs to work on my computer some.
For lunch my brother and I walked over to Juanda’s house.
We had pork, potatoe salad, and rive.
Then we played a game of triangle dominoes.
Since I lost the game I walked up to the main house to get everyone desserts.
Next we all watched the movie “Django Unchained” (2012).
We paused it half way through to go with Juanda as he ran some errands.
Once we got back the power was out so we just hung out.
I fried some cheese for us to eat and we snacked on other things.
Then we had some cinnamon toast.
For a real dinner I made us scrambled eggs and ham.
Next we went back to Juanda’s house to finish the movie from earlier.
After that we went back to the main house.
Realizing it wasn’t too late we decided to watch another movie, but first I got ready for bed.
The second movie we watched was called “Mad Max: Fury Road” (2015).
Glad I brushed my teeth before, because it made going to bed afterwards much easier.
I did go to bed late, but not by a huge chunk at least.
