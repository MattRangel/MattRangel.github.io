July 11, 2021 - Sunday
Had an arepa and scrambled eggs for breakfast.
Today my brother abd I went with Juan Ma to the club his family goes to.
At the club we played tennis for a while.
Then we swam for a bit until it was lunch time.
For lunch we had pork chuleta.
Then we went back to swimming for a bit.
Next we played ping pong and then had some ice cream.
After ice cream we sat in the sauna.
Then I just sat down, because I didn’t feel like getting back in the pool.
We left shortly after that.
Back at Juan’s house his mom made us sandwiches.
The rest of the day I just hung out not doing too much.
I was going to watch a movie, but never got around to looking for a good one.
Later on in the night for dinner we had sausages in bread.
I went to bed a little late tonight, but not super bad.
