July 10, 2021 - Saturday
Even though I went to bed late I didn’t really sleep in real late, because the sun was in my eyes and woke me up.
After taking a shower and getting dressed for the day I sat outside down stairs.
Pretty soon after coming down I was eating lunch.
For lunch I had some eggs and breads.
Following breakfast I just hung out on the patio and looked at things on my phone.
Later on after my brother woke up I went on a little walk with him.
Then we had chicken chuleta for lunch.
After that I just went back to hanging out.
In the afternoon my brother and I went to our friend Juan Ma’s house to spend the night.
Once we got there Juan ordered a pizza.
We watched soccer on TV while we ate.
After eating we played a board game.
Then we watched the movie “Kung Fu Hustle” (2004).
Movie ended late, so after that we all went to sleep.
