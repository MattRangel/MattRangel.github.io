July 5, 2021 - Monday
The plane landed in Colombia very early in the morning.
Since we were all business class we were able to get off first and get all our bags first.
Then we waited for my uncle and his friend to come pick us all up.
He ended up taking a good amount of time.
By the time we got to his apartment it was already light outside, so I didn’t go back to sleep.
I hung out in the living room.
For breakfast we all drove to a restaurant along with my uncle’s friend.
I just got a cheese arepa, but I got to try blood sausage, which I might have tried before but I can’t remember.
Following breakfast we went back to my uncle’s house.
My dad and brother went to sleep and I hung out with my uncle.
Then we went out again so my uncle could give his friend his car back.
Afterwards we got in his other friend’s car and went out for lunch.
I had an empanada and an apple juice.
Later on for dinner my uncle made shredded beef, beans, rice, and a salad.
Then my uncle and I went out abd walked around the town while he looked for cardboard boxes.
Once we got back I was going to watch a movie with my brother, but first I got distracted making tea.
Then my uncle asked me to look at hus computer.
By the time I finished with that it was too late for me to watch a movie.
I then got ready for bed.
Had to write two of these up tonight plus my eyes were acting up while I tried to look at the screen, so all that took a while.
I ended up going to bed a bit late, but atleast before midnight which is still good.
