July 2, 2021 - Friday
Today was the morning after sleeping over at my friend Ben’s house along with another friend Darious.
I woke up pretty early considering the time I went to bed last night.
Once I was up for good I spent the morning just watching different videos on YouTube on the TV.
For lunch we went to a convenience store and got some pizza rolls and other snack things.
Once we got back to Ben’s house I threw my portion of the pizza rolls into the microwave.
After we all finished eating lunch Darious and I decided to head out.
On the drive home after dropping off Darious I started to feel the effects of having slept very little.
Once I got home I asked my mom if she’d want to go to the supermarket with me to get some nes shorts.
She said sure, but it’d have to be a little later.
So I went to my room where I ended up dozing off until my mom came in my room to tell me she is ready to go.
I felt too tired to drive, so thankfully she was willing to drive for me.
On the way to the supermarket my mom ran a few errands.
I actually ended up falling in and out of sleep during that, so it went by quickly.
Once we got into the supermarket my mom quickly helped me find the shorts and then I proceeded to buy them.
Next my mom and I went to a chinese fast food restaurant to get dinner for the family.
Lastly before finally getting back home my mom dropped off the water bill.
Once we got home I grabbed my food and then ate with my mom and brother.
Afterwards I went to my room for the night until it started to get late.
I did a good job at getting off of my phone once it got late, but writing two entries in one night took up quite a bit of time.
