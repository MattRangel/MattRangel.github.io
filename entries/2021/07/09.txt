Woke up early again to take plane to Cali Colombia.
On the plane ride I watched some more of “Princess Mononoke” (1997) with my brother.
The plane ride wasn’t very long, so we didn’t finish the movie.
Dad’s friend Silvio picked us up from the airport and took us back to his natural reserve.
Once we got there we had lunch.
Then I just hjng out for a while.
Later on in the afternoon my brother and I went out with Silvio’s son Juan Da.
We met up with his friends and first went to a Italian restaurant in a mall then to a bar.
We got home pretty late and I went to bed nowhere near my target time.
