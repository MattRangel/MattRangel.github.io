July 14, 2021 - Wednesday
For breakfast my dad made me a couple soft boiled eggs.
I also had some bread with cheese and leftover french toast.
Then I brought my laptop down stairs and worked on my computer up until lunch time.
For lunch we went down to the restaurant.
After lunch I worked on my computer a bit more before going to the pool with my brother.
After we finished swimming I walked up the mountain with the dog.
Once I got back down the mountain I went swimming again.
Then I cane back to the house and took a shower.
After that I went to town with my dad and Silvio while they got things for the house and restaurant.
Once we got back I helped carry some things.
Then my dad made some hotdogs for dinner.
After dinner my brother and I went with Juanda to his house to play triangle dominos.
Next we were going to watch a movie.
It took a while to find one and by the time it actually got pulled up it was getting late.
So my brother and I left to go home.
I spent a while to get ready for bed while I texted with friends.
By the time I did go to sleep it was a bit late, but not super bad.
