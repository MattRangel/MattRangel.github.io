July 7, 2021 - Wednesday
We were all going to go to a hot spring today, but when we got there it was closed.
So we went back home for the day.
For lunch my dad made some stir fry.
I just hung out in the living room for most of the day.
Later on in the night I went shopping with my uncle.
Once we got back home we went out again to get the bananas he had forgotten.
While we walked around the town and after we got back he gave me a small lesson in spanish.
At the store I got some marshmallows.
Went to bed at an alright time tonight.
