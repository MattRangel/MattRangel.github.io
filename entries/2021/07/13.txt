July 13, 2021 - Tuesday
Brother let me brush my teeth get ready for the day in the bathroom before he started his shower.
Then I went downstairs and hung out a bit before breakfast.
Once my brother came downstairs we had breakfast.
For breakfast my dad made us french toast.
Then I basically just hung out until it was lunch time.
The internet stopped working while I was hanging out, so I watched some “South Park” (1997) episodes I had downloaded.
For lunch my dad made tortilla soup and then mexican tacos.
Two of Juan Da’s friends also joined us for lunch.
Following lunch we all went and looked at Juan’s horses and sheep.
Then we came back down to the house and hung out on the patio.
We stayed there until more of Juan’s friends came, and then we moved to a bigger area in front of Juan’s house.
I was one of the first to leave after I started getting a little tired and didn’t want to stay up too late.
Went to bed just about on time.
