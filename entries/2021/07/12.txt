July 12, 2021 - Monday
After waking up my dad called me to tell me he was on his way to pick my brother and I up.
Quickly ate an arepa and strawberries for breakfast.
Once we got back to the natural reserve I just hung out until lunch time.
For lunch we had a bean thing with avacado and pork in it.
Then my brother and I went up the mountain with Juan Da to the swimming pool.
We took the short route, but it was much steeper.
Was exhausted by the time we got there.
We swam and hung out there and also played some foot bag.
The way back down was much quicker.
After we got back I took a shower.
Then went to Juan Daâ€™s room to look at his PS4 controller.
Tried a bunch of different things all the way up until dinner and nothing really worked.
For dinner my dad made sushi for everyone.
After dinner I went back up stairs for the night.
I actually went to bed pretty close to on time tonight.
