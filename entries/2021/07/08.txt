July 8, 2021 - Thursday￼
Woke up early this morning to go and get Covid tested with brother and dad.
Uncle came along and his friend drove us.
Before going to the test we all had breakfast.
I ordered a shredded beef arepa and coffee.
After the test we went to the bank.
First one was too full sone we went to another.
While we waited for my dad we all walked around the area.
Then after he finished we went back home.
Later on we went out again to a neighboring city and had some coffee.
After getting back home I hung oyt a while.
In the night we went out again to get the iPhone 4 from the repair man.
He wasn’t able to fix any of the problems there were though.
Next we went to a bar then an arepa restaurant for dinner.
I got hawaiian, beef, and everything arepas.
Went back home after eating.
I layed in my bed for a while before I got started on my packing.
It didn’t take long once I did get started.
Then I hung out some more.
I talked with my uncle and played a game where he named capitals of different places.
I ended up going to bed very very late, which isn’t the most ideal since I have to wake up early tomorrow.
