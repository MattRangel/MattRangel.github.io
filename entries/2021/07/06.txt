July 6, 2021 - Tuesday
The plan for today was to get a rental car, but after Jorge’s friend dropped us off we couldn’t find the place.
So my dad cancelled the rental and we all walked to a mall.
At the mall we got some coffee then my brother ate a burger.
Next we went and got a haircut for my brother.
While he and my dad were doing that my uncle and I walked around the mall.
Once brother was done with haircut we got a taxi ride to a restaurant.
There was a bunch of good stuff to choose from.
I ended up getting sea food pasta.
Then we got a taxi back home.
At home I grabbed the old iPhone 4 and then we walked to a place that could fix the speakers.
After that we walked to a bar and sat outside for a while.
Left and came back a few times.
First to get ice cream with dad.
Second to get empanadas with my uncle.
We ended up staying at the bar until Colombia started playing soccer.
Stayed for half the game then headed back home.
At home we finished watching the game and I had some grapes.
Colombia ended up loosing the game.
Then I hung out in my room for a bit before getting ready for bed.
Went to bed late again tonight, but a little bit better than yesterday atleast.
