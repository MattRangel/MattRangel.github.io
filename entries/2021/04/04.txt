April 4, 2021 - Sunday
For easter today my dad and I drove over to my cousin Matias’ house for lunch.
While I got ready before leaving I talked on the phone with my mom.
During the drive this morning I had a pop-tart for breakfast.
Once we got to Matias’ house I spent the day hanging out with him as well as other family that was there.
For lunch my dad made some steak fajita for everyone to make their own tacos.
A little while after lunch my dad and I headed back home.
Right before getting homr my dad asked me to make a stop at Walgreens for him to get some vitamin gummies.
Once we got back home my aunt Annette had just finished making dinner.
For dinner she made fried rice and chicken.
After dinner I had a bowl of ice cream and then another bowl of rice.
During dinner my uncle Oscar put on the movie “Zach Snyder’s Justice League” (2021).
It was a long movie, so I only ended up watching about half of it before going to bed.
I had gotten ready for bed while I was watching the movie, so once I stopped it for the night I was ready to go to bed shortly after.
Tonight I went to bed at a very good time.
