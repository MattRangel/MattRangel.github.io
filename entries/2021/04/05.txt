April 5, 2021 - Monday
Today was a pretty easy short school day.
Although I had work to do in most my classes I didn’t need too much brain power for it.
After school I reheated some of the fried rice from yesterday and ate a granola bar for lunch.
Then I called the thrift store I volunteer at to tell them I’d be able to work today.
After getting dresses I hit the road, bit then I had to turn around since I forgot my log.
Work at the thrift store today was fine.
I was a bit tired today, but if I remember correctly that’s normal for me during the days between transitioning￼ from sleeping a bad amount to good amount.
Once I got back home from work I layed in bed on my phone for a little bit while I waited for dinner.
For dinner my aunt Annette made frito pie￼ and my dad reheated some of the fried rice from yesterday.
During dinner I put back on the movie “Zach Snyder’s Justice League” (2021) which I had started yesterday.
I had some raisins for dessert after finishing my dinner.
Right after the movie ended I got ready for bed and then went to sleep.
I went to bed at a very good time once again tonight.
