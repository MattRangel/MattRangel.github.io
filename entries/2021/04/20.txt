April 20, 2021 - Tuesday
School day today was short and pretty easy.
After school I continued my work on my computer from yesterday, which was setting up my computer after installing a new operating system.
I sat in my bed working for a while until I finished a part that I was stuck on for a little bit.
Then I decided to take a break to see if my aunt and uncle needed any help.
After eating an orange I helped them move some exercise equipment into the workout room.
Next I made myself a sandwich and sat out in the living for a bit.
Then I brought my computer out to the living room and worked there for a while.
I took another break when my aunt finished heating up some chicken wings.
After the chicken wings I took my computer back to my room where I worked until it was time for dinner.
For dinner my aunt made chicken and rice.
I also had some crackers after finishing my dinner.
Following dinner I went to my room and worked on my computer even more until I solved a problem I was stuck on for a while.
Then I read my book “The Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett”.
Once it started to get late I quit reading and then got ready for bed.
Before and after getting ready for bed though I wasted some time on my phone.
I ended up going to bed at an alright time, but not as perfect as I try to aim for.
