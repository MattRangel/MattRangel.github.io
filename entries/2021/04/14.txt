April 14, 2021 - Wednesday
During my first class today I had a test, but it ended up getting cancelled which was a nice start to the day.
For lunch I reheated some fried rice and also had an orange.
While I was in my last class of the day my mom called me and we chatted for a while.
Following school I watched the movie “Kidulthood” (2006).
Right as I was finishing the movie my aunt Annette and uncle Oscar got home.
My uncle showed me another pellet gun he as and also flew around the drone a bit.
For dinner my aunt cooked a pot pie.
While I ate dinner I watched cooking shows on TV.
Following dinner I went back to my room until it got late.
Then I got ready for bed.
I didn’t do super great at stopping what I was doing to go to bed on time tonight.
