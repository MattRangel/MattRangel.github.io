April 26, 2021 - Monday
My classes for today were all very easy, which was a really nice start to my day.
After school I ate some of the sandwiches from yesterday for lunch.
Then I had an orange and watched the movie “Cloud Atlas” (2012).
As I was starting the movie my aunt Annette and uncle Oscar got home from work.
I paused the movie and helped my uncle carry some furniture they got for the patio.
After that I started up the movie again.
While I watched the movie I had another sandwich and a bowl of popcorn.
Following the movie I drove to the supermarket to get some more face lotion.
I couldn’t find the exact one that I had, but there was one pretty similar so hopefully it’ll be just as good.
While I was there I got some colored pencils for art class too.
I was also going to get some halibut for my aunt, but there was only one package and she needed three.
By the time I got home dinner had been finished.
For dinner my aunt made chicken and yellow rice.
Following dinner I took a shower and got ready for bed.
Then I just hung out in my room until it got late.
I went to bed a tiny bit late tonight, but for sure at a better time than the last few days.
