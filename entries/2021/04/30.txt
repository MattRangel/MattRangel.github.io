April 30, 2021 - Friday
In all of my classes today I had very little to no work.
During all that free time I just hung out on my phone.
One of the things I did was watch prank videos of a guy dressed as a bush jumping out at people.
After school I came out of my room to hang out with everyone.
My uncle Oscar’s family was still visiting from the day before.
For lunch I heated up some yellow rive from a few days ago.
Then I drank a can of coconut water which my aunt Annette had bought for me a few days ago.
Later in the day when my aunt got back from work she made me a sandwich for lunch.
While she was making it I also ate a banana.
Following my second lunch I watched the movie “Cast Away” (2000).
During that movie my uncle’s sister brought BBQ sandwiches for dinner.
I was still stuffed from having two lunch, so I only ended up eating half of my sandwich.
After I finished the movie I put on another one called “Hang Em’ High” (1968).
I paused that movie once my uncle’s family started to leave.
After saying goodbye to everyone I came back inside and finished the movie.
My aunt also watched the end of the movie with me.
So after the movie ended we put on the show “Money Heist” (2017), which I had started rewatching with her a week or two ago.
After a few episodes I turned off the TV, so that I wouldn’t stay up too late.
Next I hung out in my room for a bit before getting ready for bed.
Eventually I did brush my teeth and take a shower.
I didn’t do too great at going to bed on time tonight, but thankfully I don’t have to wake up for anything early tomorrow.
