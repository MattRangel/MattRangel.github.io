April 13, 2021 - Tuesday
I didn’t really do anything during school today since I’m ahead in all my classes.
Towards the end of my last class I ate some arepas that my aunt Annette made for lunch.
Shortly after I finished school I went to the grocery store with my aunt.
Once we got back home I had an orange and hung out in the living room.
I also shot my uncle Oscar’s air rife some and even got a bird.
After I was finished hanging out in the living room I took a shower.
For dinner my aunt made fried rice and chicken.
Following dinner I had a slice of cheese cake with cherries on top.
Then my uncle and I went on a 14 mile bike ride.
After getting back home my uncle made a papaya smoothie.
There was a some left over so I also made some popsicles as an experiment.
Then I took a shower and got ready for bed.
I only went to bed a tad bit late tonight, so hopefully I wont be too sleepy tomorrow.
