April 3, 2021 - Saturday
I slept in late this morning since it was the first time I’ve been able to sleep a full night.
After waking up I hung out in my room watching YouTube and TikTok videos for a while.
For breakfast there was grits, bacon, potatoes, and scrambled eggs.
I also had some raisins after finishing.
Next I went back to my room and back on my phone.
Later on I switched to watching the movie “Taxidermia” (2006).
I paused the movie half way through to have lunch.
For lunch my aunt Annette made sandwiches.
Following dinner I went back to my room again and then finished watching the movie.
The next movie I watched was a documentary called “Hands on a Hardbody” (1998).
After that movie I went back to scrolling through my phone until dinner time.
for dinner my dad, uncle, aunt, and I went to a Latin restaurant.
I ordered a seafood soup, which was good but way too much.
Leaving the restaurant I went backwards through an area to turn on to the road.
I then ended up getting pulled over, but thankfully all I got was a warning.
On the drive home my dad and uncle played songs off of my phone.
Once I got home I layed down in bed on my phone for way too long.
I should’ve gotten ready for bed right away, but instead I let myself get distracted until it got very late.
