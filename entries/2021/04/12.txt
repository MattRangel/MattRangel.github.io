April 12, 2021 - Monday
During my lunch break from school today I reheated myself some of the gumbo from the other day.
After school I drove to Target to buy a laundry basket.
While I was at Target I looked around at other things and ended up buying some floss and a small roll of cookies.
On my way back home my aunt Annette called me and asked for me to grab something from the store.
Since I had already left I just stopped at the grocery store near the house.
She needed me to get some mini hamburger buns.
After I bought them I went to buy a $1 scratch lottery ticket, but the machine confused me so I left.
Once I got home I gave my aunt the bread and then sat on the couch to finish my cookies.
I also ate an apple and a slice of papaya.
My uncle Oscar was out in the living room too setting up a printer so I helped him a tiny bit with that too.
Then I went to my room and hung out until dinner was finished.
For dinner my aunt and uncle made sliders and sweet potatoe fries.
During dinner we watched the tail end of the movie “Escape from Alcatraz” (1979), which I had already seen anyways.
Following dinner I went to my room again for a while.
I was going to watch a movie, but never ended up feeling like putting the time towards it.
Instead I helped my uncle move some boxes from one room to another while he looked for the printer paper.
Then I went back to my room again until it started to get late.
At that point I got ready for bed and then went to sleep.
I did very good at not waiting too long to get ready for bed tonight.
Additionally I didn’t get distracted after finishing to get ready, which meant I went to bed right on time.
