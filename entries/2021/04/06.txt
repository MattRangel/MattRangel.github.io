April 6, 2021 - Tuesday
My schoolday today was a bit weird, because we were on testing schedule.
So I was a bit confused and ended up only having a 10 minute lunch.
Besides all that I kept busy with work pretty much throughout the whole school day.
After school I ate some fried rice since all I had for lunch was a granola bar.
Then I came back to my room and just hung out.
I watched some YouTube and chatted with friends.
Was going to watch a movie, but I never ended up getting the energy.
For dinner my uncle Oscar made corn, toast, chicken, and baked potatoes.
After dinner I got ready for bed and took a shower.
I spent a little too long laying in bed on my phone, but I still went to bed at a pretty good time compared to last week.
