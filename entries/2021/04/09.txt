April 9, 2021 - Friday
My school day today was pretty relaxed.
After school I took out the trash and the ate lunch.
For lunch I reheated some gumbo and rice.
Then my dad and I packed the car and went to the beach.
It was weird playing at the beach all by myself without my brother.
After the beach my dad and I stopped at pizza restaurant for dinner.
Once we got back home I had a slice of cheesecake.
Then I put my clothes in the washer which took a couple tries to get working with my dad.
After I got ready for bed I stayed up a while longer.
I was going to watch the movie “Burning” (2018) which I started yesterday, but by the time I got the energy it was too late in the night.
I didn’t go to bed extreamly late, but still late to me because I still wanted to go to bed on time.
