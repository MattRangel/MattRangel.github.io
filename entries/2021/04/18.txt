April 18, 2021 - Sunday
I spent this morning switching between hanging out on my phone and reading the book “The Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett”.
I just picked up the book again today after not reading it for quite a while.
Now that I’ve started it again though I think I’ll be reading it more.
For breakfast I had an orange.
Then for lunch my uncle Oscar brought sandwhiches.
After lunch I pretty much kept of my routine of phone and book until it was time for dinner.
For dinner my uncle and aunt Annette made chicken, toast, beans, and quinoa.
Following dinner my uncle and I went for a short ride on the fourwheelers.
Once we got back I took a shower and got ready for bed.
I didn’t go to bed right after though, and instead stayed up a bit longer than I should’ve procrastinating writing this up.
