April 1, 2021 - Thursday
Waking up this morning I was pretty tired.
That doesn’t suprise me, because I haven’t really been doing too great at going to bed on time lately.
My school day today kind of dragged on.
For lunch I reheated some pasta and also had a granola bar.
Then I tried to call with a university about my residency and applying.
I wasn’t able to talk with anyone super helpful, so my dad and I are just going to drive up there tomorrow.
After school I spent a while just scrolling through my phone.
Then I got tired and took a nap.
Once I woke up I watched the movie “Animal Factory” (2000).
After that movie my aunt Annette finished making potpie for dinner.
Following dinner I watched the movie “The Eight Hundred” (2020).
Next I hung out a while more and then got ready for bed.
Before and after getting ready for bed I spent a bit longer than I should’ve just hanging out.
I also have to wake up early to go to the university tomorrow.
So hopefully I wont wake up too extremely￼ tired.
