April 19, 2021 - Monday
Today was an average easy school day.
While I wasn’t doing anything I watched YouTube.
For lunch my aunt Annette made me a tuna sandwich.
After my last class I kept watching YouTube for a while.
Then I switched to working on my computer.
I wanted to switch my operating system and also try a new desktop environment￼.
I worked on my computer until dinner time.
For dinner we had chicken wings, fried rice, beans, and quinoa.
Following dinner I went back to working on my computer until it was late.
I ended up going to bed a bit late again tonight.
