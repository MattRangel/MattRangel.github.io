April 2, 2021 - Friday
I had the day off from school today, but I still woke up bright and early.
My dad and I were going to drive up to my prospective university to ask some questions about residency requirements.
I did yhe whole drive there which was about two and a half hours.
We found somewhere to parked and then had to play the game of finding buildings and trying to talk to people.
There ended up being really anyone there that could help us.
So after getting some papers from different offices we headed back home.
My dad made the drive back.
On our way we stopped at Cracker Barrel and then Walmart.
We actually went to two Cracker Barrels, because the first one had too long of a wait time.
For my luch I ordered some french toast.
Then we stopped at Walmart and Publix then went home.
Once we got back I plopped down in bed until it was time for dinner.
For dinner we had chicken, rice, and beans.
After dinner I went back to my room and worked on getting the energy to put on a movie.
While I was about to my dad called for me and asked if I’d like to put a movie on in the living room.
I ended up choosing the movie “The Man From Earth” (2007).
During the movie I had a bowl of ice cream with brownie.
Following the movie I hung out in my room for a little and thrn got ready for bed.
Next I called back my mom, because I wasn’t able to talk with her when she called me during the movie earlier.
Then I wrote up this entry and then went to sleep.
I didn’t go to bed at too great of a time, but thankfully I don’t think I’m going to have to wake up early for anything tomorrow.
Definitely￼ going to have to make a better point to go to sleep on time this next week.
