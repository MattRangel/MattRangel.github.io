April 10, 2021 - Saturday
For breakfast this morning I had some left over pizza.
While I was out there I startled my uncle Oscar with a funny baby mask.
Then I went back to my room and hung out for a bit.
My uncle’s sister came over and brought pastries.
I had a coconut one and then a meat one.
After that I took my clean clothes to my room and folded all of them.
Next I put back on the movie “Burning” (2018), which I started the other day but never finished.
The next movie I watched was later in the day and called “Total Recall” (1990).
During that movie I ate dinner.
For dinner my uncle made steak, mashed potatoes, corn, and rice.
With a few minites left to the movie I paused it to go outside and ride the four wheeler.
My uncle had to reteach me, because it was so long ago when my dad taught me that I had forgotten.
I eventually got the hang of it and went down the street.
Once I came back my uncle taught me how to do a donut before I put it away.
Obce I came back inside I went to my room and just hung out for a while.
I ended up hanging out way too long and didn’t get ready for bed until it was very late.
After I got ready for bed I hung out a bit more before finishing the last few minutes of “Total Recall” (1990).
Then I finally went to bed.
The time I’m going to bed tonight wouldn’t be a problem normally on a weekend, but I have to wake up early tomorrow to take my dad to the airport.
