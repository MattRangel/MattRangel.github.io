April 25, 2021 - Sunday
This morning my aunt Annette, uncle Oscar, and I woke up very early to go to my cousin Mathias’ house for his birthday.
On our way there we stopped at Krispy Kream for doughnuts.
Once we got to Mathias’ house I said hello to everyonr else there.
Mathias and I played outside for a while until breakfast time.
For breakfast there were doughnuts, casserole, and bagles.
Then my uncle Oscar, cousin Mathias, uncle Juan (Mathias’ dad), and I all went to a park.
At the park there were a few mountain bike trails which we road.
Doing the trails exhausted me, but luckily my uncle Juan went slow with me and coached me.
After biking we rode back to the car and had lunch.
For lunch we had some sandwiches that my Aunt had made for us.
We talked for a while, and then my uncle Oscar and I headed out.
We headed back to Mathias’ house to pick up my aunt Annette and then we headed home.
Once we got back home I went to my room and hung out on my phone for a while.
For dinner my aunt made chicken wings, rice, beans, and reheated some chuleta.
Following dinner I went with my aunt to help her pick up a shelf she found for sale on the internet.
On our way back home we stopped at the supermarket to get some drinks.
Then we stopped again at an ATM, so my aunt could pay me back the money I loaned her to buy the shelves.
By the time we got home it was already kinda late, because the drive was pretty long.
Before and during getting ready for bed I got distracted texting with my friend Sherry, which made the process take a bit longer.
Once I finally went to bed it was pretty late for a school night.
I’m definitely going to have to make a good point to go to bed on time the rest of the week.
