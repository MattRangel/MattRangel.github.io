April 11, 2021 - Sunday
I woke up bright and early this morning to take my dad to the airport.
After getting ready for the day I went to wake up my dad.
He said something which I didn’t really understand, so I went back to my room for a bit.
Then I went to his room again to tell him it’s time to go.
He responded that we’re leaving at 5 in the afternoon not morning.
Realizing that I just assumed he meant morning I went back to sleep.
Once I woke back up again I had breakfast.
For breakfast my uncle Oscar made eggs, bacon, biscuts, and grits.
Following breakfast I just hung out on my phone for a while.
I watched the movie “Paranoid Park” (2007).
During the movie my brother called me for help installing a game on his computer.
After walking him through it I went back to the movie.
Following the movie my brother called me back again for some more help.
I walked him through another part of installing his computer game.
Next I had some of the cheese cake my aunt Annette made.
After cheese cake my dad, aunt, and I went over to my aunt grandma Lucy’s house.
My uncle Juan was going to pick up my dad from there and take him to the airport.
On our way to Lucy’s house we stopped at a Peruvian restaurant.
On our way back home my aunt and I stopped at the grocery store to get some soup for dinner.
The soup we chose was clam chowder.
Once we got home my aunt got started on making the soup.
Before and during dinner I watched the movie my umcle had playing on TV.
Following dinner I brushed my teeth and got ready for bed.
I went to bed at an alright time tonight.
Not too terrible, but I do try for earlier.
