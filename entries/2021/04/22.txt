April 22, 2021 - Thursday
School today was easy.
In one of my classes there was a Presentation on what graduation will look like.
I was able to submit a fourm that ￼said I’m not interested in going.
After school my aunt Annette made some arepas for lunch.
I also had a cup of yogurt.
Then I sat on the couch and hung out on my phone for a bit.
Later on I made some no bake cookies after I found the recipe from when I was a kid.
After the cookies were done I washed the dishes.
In the middle of washing the dishes I went outside to look at the block my uncle Oscar was shooting his air gun at.
After I finished the dishes I went back to the couch until the cookies were done.
Once they were finished cooling I let my aunt and uncle each try one.
Then I went back to my room for a while until it was time for dinner.
For dinner my uncle reheated some shepherd’s pie from yesterday.
After dinner I had one of the cookies I made.
Then I went outside and practiced skateboarding.
My uncle came out side too later on and drove around his mini motorcycle.
He showed me how to work it and thrn I drove around some.
After we put it away we patched the hole that was in my car tire.
Once I came back inside I made myself a cup of tea and then took a shower.
Following my shower I drank my tea and then went to my room.
I ended up getting very distracted researching pogo sticks and didn’t finish getting ready for bed until it was very late.
Then afterwards I got distracted again some.
Tonight was definitely￼ not a success at going to bed on time.
