April 7, 2021 - Wednesday
I had to leave class a little early today, because we were still on a weird schedule.
I dodnâ€™t really have time to eat any lunch, so I just grabbed a granola bar before leaving for work.
Today was my last day working at the thrift store.
After I finished working I bought two CDs and a cooler to keep in my car from the thrift store.
Then before heading home I bought some ice cream from a gelato place for my aunt, uncle, and dad.
Once I got home I had dinner.
For dinner my dad made gumbo.
Then some friends of my dad came over, so I ended up not eating the ice cream tonight.
I stood outside with them while they spoke before coming back inside to get ready for bed.
I spent a bit too long just hanging out after that and ended up going to bed a bit late.
