April 15, 2021 - Thursday
My school day today was super easy.
Following school I reheated some fried rice for lunch and then had an orange.
During my lunch I talked on the phone with my mom.
Next I got dressed and went to my covid 19 vaccine appointment.
It was a pretty easy deal, but I was there a while since I got there early.
Once I got back I said hello to my uncle Oscar.
After we were done talking outside I sat in the living room and watched TV.
While I watched I also was looking for a movie to watch.
I eventually found one called “Far From Men” (2014).
I ended up pausing the movie half way through to go pick up dinner at a Colombian restaurant for everyone.
My aunt Annette ordered it on the internet which was supposed to make it easy, but it was not.
When I got there the order had never went through on their end, so they had to manually write down the order.
Then I had to wait a very long time for them to actually cook it.
Once I got back we unpacked the food and then ate.
I ordered pork, rice, and yuca.
We also all got our own flan.
While eating we watched the movie “Frequency” (2000), which I had already seen.
Following the movie I put back on the movie I had started earlier.
Before finishing it I got ready for bed.
Then after the movie I only had to write this up and then go to sleep.
I stayed up a bit too late watching the movie, bit it’ll be fine since I can sleep in a bit tomorrow on my day off from school.
