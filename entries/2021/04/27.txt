April 27, 2021 - Tuesday
I didnâ€™t really do too much out of the ordinary today.
For lunch I had a tuna sandwich which my aunt Annette made for me and an apple.
After lunch I went outside to put some mail in the mail box for my aunt.
As I was doing that the mailman was pulling up, so I had to jog over to him.
After I finished school I pretty much just hung out for the rest of the day.
Looked at some trees that had sap on them with my uncle Oscar.
I moved my car out from under a tree with a hanging branch and dripping sap.
When my aunt got home from the store I helped her bring things inside.
Later on I gave her some money to by CDs and CD sleeves for me using her Amazon Prime account.
For dinner my aunt made chicken, potatoes, and vegetables.
Following dinner I went back to my room until it was time to get ready for bed.
I got up to get ready for bed a little late, but after that I did good at staying on task.
I went to bed at an alright time tonight.
