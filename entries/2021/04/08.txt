April 8, 2021 - Thursday
This morning I turned in my community service hours log online for school.
During my lunch break from school today I started watching the movie “Run Lola Run” (1998).
My lunch today was a bowl of reheated fried rice and a bowl of cereal.
I finished watching the movie during my last class of the day.
After school I hung out on my phone chatting with friends.
Later on I started watching the movie “Burning” (2018).
For dinner my dad made steak, rice, and beans.
Then I ate one of the ice creams I bought yesterday for my dessert.
The ice cream I chose for myself was the cinnamon one.
Once I finished eating I went back to my room and continued watching the movie from earlier.
There was too much left for me to finish it tonight, so after a bit I paused it to start getting ready for bed.
I went to sleep at a fine time tonight, but I did get a little distracted on my phone before getting ready for bed.
