April 28, 2021 - Wednesday
Today was another short and easy school day.
I got work done though, so now on Friday I won’t have to do very much work.
After school I had a deli meat sandwich for lunch which my aunt Annette made for bed.
Following lunch I went to my room and hung out in my room for a while.
Later on in the afternoon my aunt got back from the store and brought me some cans of coconut water.
She also had the CDs and CD sleeves that I ordered the other day.
After that I went to back my room and pulled out my computer.
I ended up deciding it’d be easier to install Windows to install the music program I use.
After I had Windows installed I set it up and then downloaded some music from a playlist.
Then I burned the music onto a disk.
One of the songs I forgot to crop before burning it, so I had to reburn a second disk.
Then I drew a lable on the disk and put it away in a sleeve.
After that I worked on my computer a bit to try and get the dual booting to work properly.
In the middle of working on that I took a pause to eat dinner.
For dinner my aunt made some frito pie and my uncle Oscar put it together in a bowl for me.
Following dinner I eventually figured out what was wrong with my computer, but then it kept disconnecting from the internet, so I decided to wait until another day.
After that I hung out on my phone some more until it was time to start getting ready for bed.
Tonight I went to bed a little bit late, but not too bed so I’m still happy.
