April 21, 2021 - Wednesday
During my lunch break from school today I reheated some of the chicken and rice from yesterday.
After lunch I talked with my uncle Oscar for a bit before going back to my room for my last class of the day.
Following school I read my book “The Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett”.
Following that I came out of my room and hung out in the living room.
I talked with my aunt Annette and uncle while they cooked dinner.
My uncle and I also shot his air gun a little bit.
For dinner we had shepherd’s pie.
For dessert I had some ice cream with  wafers on top.
Following dessert I went to my room and read until it got late.
Then I brushed my teeth and got ready for bed.
Once again I went to bed a bit late missing my target because of getting distracted on my phone.
