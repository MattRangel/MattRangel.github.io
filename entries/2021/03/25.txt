March 25, 2021 - Thursday
I woke up pretty tired this morning, but after being up for a little bit I felt more awake.
My school day today was pretty easy.
Right after school my grandma gave me a small sandwich and some soup, because lunch wasn’t going to be ready for a while.
After that snack I went to my room and hung out on my phone until lunch time.
For lunch my grandma made hen, rice, soup, and vegetables.
Shortly after lunch my mom called me telling me she got a dentist appointment for me.
My teeth were all clean and all the people there were very nice.
Next I drove to my brother’s school to pick him up and go back to our grandparents’ house.
Once I got back I went back to watching YouTube and scrolling through social media on my phone.
Later on I started watching the movie “The Stepford Wives” (1975).
I paused the movie to take a shower and then eat dinner.
For dinner my grandma put the hen from earlier with some pasta.
After dinner I finished watching the movie I started earlier.
Then I stayed up a bit more scrolling through my phone before getting to bed.
I went to sleep earlier than I have been for the past few days, but still not most ideal time.
