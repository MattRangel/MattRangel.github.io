March 27, 2021 - Saturday
My dad did the majority of the driving this trip to Florida.
I hadn’t been sleep good the past few weeks and so I didn’t have a ton of energy.
Once we finally got back to home in Florida my dad and I had dinner.
For dinner my aunt Annette made steak and cabbage and then some cookies for dessert.
Then I sat in bed on my phone for a bit before taking a shower and getting ready for bed.
After that I stayed up a while more writing up the entries for today and yesterday.
