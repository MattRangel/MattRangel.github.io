March 7, 2021 - Sunday
Today was a pretty relaxed day.
After waking up and brushing my teeth I ate breakfast.
My uncle Oscar and aunt Annette made a biscut with sausage gravy and an egg.
Following breakfast I watched cable TV for a while.
I watched a show called “Hoarders” and then another one called “How it’s Made”.
While I watched TV I ate a bowl of cereal that my dad got me from the store.
After a while I got tired of TV and all the commercials, so I put on a movie instead.
The first movie I watched was called “The Warriors” (1979).
After that movie I watched another one called “For a Few Dollars More” (1965).
The next movie I watched was “A Bronx Tale” (1993).
Towards the end of that movie I atarted eating dinner.
For dinner we had pork, steak, beans, rice, arepa, and sausage.
The last movie I watched today was “Taps” (1981).
Following that movie I got ready for bed.
By the time I was all ready to go to bed I still had a little time to spare which was cool.
I went to bed right on time tonight.
