I’m writing this the next day, because I fell asleep without writing it.
I was still in school when my grandma finished making lunch, so by the time I actually did eat I had to reheat my food.
After lunch I took a nap, which I didn’t wake up from until it was exactly time to pick up my brother up from school.
Even though I came a bit later than I usually do I was still able to pick him up and get back to our grandparents’ house pretty quick.
Once we got back I waited for him to eat lunch and then headed back home.
I packed my suitcase and things into my car, because the plan was to head back to Florida with my dad tonight.
Once I got home I helped my mom set up her computer that just had the hard drive replaced.
I also took down the christmas tree and put it in the attic.
After that I was going to watch a movie with my mom, but I ended up running out of time.
We did have time to enjoy the popcorn she made though.
My dad and I drove two different cars.
He went to the grocery store then met me at my grandparents’ house.
At their house I had a small dinner and then we headed out for Florida.
