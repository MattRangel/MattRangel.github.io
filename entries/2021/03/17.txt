March 17, 2021 - Wednesday
After brushing my teeth this morning I layed back down in my bed and watched the movie “I Stand Alone” (1998).
Following the movie I had a piece of leftover lasagna for breakfast.
Then I watched a few movies with my mom.
The first movie we watched was “Soul” (2020).
Then we watched “Coming 2 America” (2021).
The last movie we watched was “Pollyanna” (1960).
During the movie I had another piece of lasagna for lunch.
We had to pause the movie half way through while we all went out to have dinner.
For dinner we went to a build your own pizza place.
My pizza had sausage, pineapple, and onions.
On our way back home we stopped at the supermarket for my dad to grab a few things.
Once we got back home my mom and I continued our movie.
After the movie finished I got ready for bed and the washed the dishes.
I did good at not getting distracted tonight.
