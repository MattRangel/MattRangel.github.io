March 22, 2021 - Monday
I woke up early this morning to take my brother to school.
While he got ready for school I packed up all my things into my car to spend the week at my grandparents’ house.
After getting to my grandparents’ house following dropping off my brother I had breakfast.
For breakfast my grandmother made me an egg and some bread.
A little while after breakfast I went to the super market with my grandma.
She had lots of groceries to get, so we were out for quite a while.
After we got back I layed down in bed on my phone for a while until lunch was ready.
For lunch my grandma made potatoes, rice, beans, corn, and steak.
I went back on my phone again after lunch, but eventually switched over to watching a movie.
The movie I watched was called “Made in Britain” (1982).
Following the movie I took a shower and then ate dinner.
For dinner my grandma cooked macaroni in white sauce with mushrooms and mim sausages.
After dinner I went back to my room.
I ended up staying up a bit too late procrastinating getting ready for bed and having to write this up.
I also don’t really feel like starting school again, so that was probably an aspect too.
