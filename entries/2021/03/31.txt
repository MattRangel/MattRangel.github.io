March 31, 2021 - Wednesday
In school today I only had one class where I actually had to do something.
That was just drawing a little picture for art class.
In my other two classes all I had to do was just listen to the teachers talk.
I saved some time by eating lunch during my last class.
For lunch I reheated a bowl of white rice and then had a bowl of cereal.
After that I went to work at my volunteer job at the thrift store.
It was a pretty regular work day.
Once I got home I hung out for a bit before getting started on folding and laundry.
While I folded I watched the TV show “Daria” (1997).
I took a break from folding one dinner was ready.
For dinner my dad made chicken, sweet potatoes, and yellow rice.
Shortly after lunch I rode the four wheelers with my dad and uncle Oscar.
The four wheeler I rode on with my uncle was much faster than the one my dad used yesterday.
After I got back inside I got started on the folding again.
Then my dad asked if I wanted to take him to the supermarket and get some ice cream.
The super market trip was quick and we also got some grapes.
Once we got back I had my bowl of ice cream before going back to my room to finish the folding.
I ended up staying up too late after I finished going.
When I finally did get the energy to brush my teeth my dad was using the bathroom, so I just used the kitchen sink quickly.
Tonight’s bed time was not a success!
