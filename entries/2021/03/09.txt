March 9, 2021 - Tuesday
During school today I got all my work done a little early.
While I sat through my last class of the day I ate lunch.
For lunch my dad gave me an egg biscut sandwich.
After my school day was finished I started getting ready to go to my volunteer job at the thrift store.
Once I got there I was shown how to organize the clothes.
Then I was left on my own to hang up the rest of the clothes they needed.
After I finished that I helped assist with other things.
Overall the work was actually pretty enjoyable.
Once I was done I signed out on their log and then headed home.
Once I got home dinner was being finished.
For dinner my uncle oscar made tacos.
Following dinner I drove my dad to the hardware store.
After we got back I took a shower.
Following that I went to my room and hung out until it started to get late.
Then I got all ready for bed and went to sleep.
I waited too long to started getting ready for bed and ended up going to bed late tonight.
