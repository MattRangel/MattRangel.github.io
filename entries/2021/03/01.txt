Today wasn’t too difficult of a school day.
Puled out my fountain pen and drew a cool thing for art class.
After school for lunch I heated up some leftover chili and pasta.
Then I went back to my room and watched youtube for a while.
Then I watched a documentary.
Following the documentary I watched some more youtube.
When my dad got back home I went along with him to the store.
After getting his things we also got some grapes and apples.
Once we got back home I just went back to youtube until dinner was ready.
For dinner my dad made steak, rice, and beans to eat with tortillas.
Following dinner I watvhed the movie “Into the Wild” (2007).
Watching the movie put me going to bed a bit late.
Not terribly late, but still not really close to my goal.
