March 5, 2021 - Friday
Waking up this morning I remembered I dream I had very well, but I didn’t write it down in my night stand journal like I probably should’ve.
Today was just another school day.
It was a short one and I was also done with my work im all my classes, which made for a nice start to my day.
Towards the end of my school day I started putting in work towards finding a good place to volunteer.
I need to have 20 hours to graduate from my high school here in Florida.
It was a bit overwhelming trying to find a good place.
I even called with my mom to see if she had any ideas.
Eventually I found a place that fit my schedule and that I’d also actually enjoy working at.
It was a thrift store and cat rescue shelter.
Then I made myself a sandwhich for lunch.
Following lunch I called with my mom to tell her I found a place and also to plan what I’d do if I don’t get an answer.
Once I called someone did answer though and I explained I wanted to volunteer.
The lady on the phone said I could come over today to fill out an application.
Before leaving I took a shower, changed clothes, and cut my nails.
The drive there was a alright with a few twists and turns.
Once I got there I spoke with the person who I talked with on the phone.
She gave me an application to fill out which I did right there.
After filling it out I gave it back to them and explained the next few days I’d be able to work.
Then I got in the car and went back home.
Getting back home I just went to my room and layed down hanging out on my phone for a while.
For dinner my aunt Annette cooked chicken, mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy, and asparagus.
Then I came back to my room again until dessert was ready.
For dessert there was cinnamon rolls and ice cream.
Then I got back in bed once again until it started to get late.
After that I got all ready for bed and went to sleep.
I went to bed a little bit passed my target again, but for the weekend it was still pretty good.
