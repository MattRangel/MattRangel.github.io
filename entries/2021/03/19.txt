This morning my brother and I rode along with my dad to Waco.
We went to waco, because my dad was looking at a car he might buy.
He ended up deciding not to get the truck.
After that we went to and called several places to see if they had a part for my dad’s lawn mower.
None of the places in Waco had the parts, but the store back near our house had one of them.
We ate at a Mediterranean places and got gyros.
After luch we headed back home.
On the way home my dad stopped at the store for the lawn mower part.
I drove the rest of the way home.
Once we got home I went on a walk with my mom.
Then I hung out in my room for a tiny bit before my dad called for me.
He needed me to mow the lawn, and so that’s what I did until it got too dark to see.
Then I took a shower and went back to my room.
While I was in my room my dad and brother worked on fixing my car.
I was waiting for them to finish so that I could use the car to go over to my grandparents’ house.
Going to my grandparents’ house so late, because I’m taking them somewhere in the morning tomorrow.
Anyways, after a while my dad told me to just take his truck instead.
So I headed over to my grandparents’ house, playing music off my phone speakers in my lap while I drove.
After getting to my grandparents’ house I ate dinner.
My grandma heated me up some yellow rice with shrimp.
Following dinner I got ready for bed and then stayed up a while more.
I probably shouldn’t have stayed up any later, but it’s whatever.
