March 10, 2021 - Wednesday
In pretty much all of my classes today I had little to no work which made for an easy day.
While I wasnâ€™t doing anything else in one of my classes I worked on revising my college essay a bit.
During my lunch break I ate some sausage and grits.
With the rest of my lunch break I layed down and watched YouTube.
Following my last class of the day I started getting ready to go to the DMV.
Before getting dressed I took a quick shower to make my hair a little less crazy.
Once I got to the DMV I was able to check in easily and everything went smoothly.
At the DMV today I was switching my Texas drivers ID to a Florida one.
After it was all finished I got my new Florida license right away since they had a printer for it.
Before leaving I video called with my mom to tell her the news.
Once I got back home I went to my room and hung out until dinner was ready.
For dinner my uncle made fried rice and chicken.
Following dinner I went back to my room and just hung out on my phone some more until it started to get late.
Like yesterday I waited a bit too long to start getting ready for bed and ended up going to sleep a little late.
