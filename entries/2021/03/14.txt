For breakfast I ate oatmeal.
Then my whole family went to Round Rock.
First we ate at a taco place for lunch.
Then we went to the mall.
We didn’t go inside too many places, because all the lines were so long.
Following the mall we went to a country boots and clothes store.
We were there for a quite a bit while my brother picked out boots and jeans for his birthday.
On our way back home we stopped at the grocery store.
Once we got home I went to my room and hung out until dinner was ready.
For dinner my dad made steak, potatoes, and vegetables.
Following the movie my mom and I watched the movie “Dead Presidents” (1995).
The movie ended kind of late, but after it I stayed up even later while I procrastinated writing up this.
