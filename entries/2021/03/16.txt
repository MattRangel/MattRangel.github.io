Prior to leaving for my grandparents’ house this morning I got the trash from around the house.
Before getting to my grandparents’ house I stopped at the mechanic to get an oil change and car inspection.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house lunch wasn’t ready yet, so I just hung out in my room for a bit.
For lunch my grandma made tomatoe soup and pork chuleta.
Following lunch I went back to my room and watched YouTube for a while until it was time for my tire rotation appointment.
Even though I had an appointment the whole ordeal still took a while.
After it was all done I headed back over to my grandparents’ house.
Once I got there I put on the movie “Dumb and Dumber” (1994), which my aunt Annette had told me was one of their favorites.
Following the movie it was already almost lunch time, so I was only back in my room for a little bit before comming back out again.
For dinner my grandma made a sandwich and reheated some of the soup from earlier.
Following dinner I stayed at my grandparents’ house for a while longer before coming home.
On the way home I blasted music really loud with my brother.
Once I got home I just plopped down in bed on my phone.
Once it began to get late I got ready for bed.
Then I washed the dishes.
I was also going to start a movie after all that, but I decided not to because I didn’t want to stay up too late again.
It was already a little late by the time I actually went to bed.
