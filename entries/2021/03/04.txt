March 4, 2021 - Thursday
Today was a normal school day.
I had a test in my first period.
Then my next class I worked ahead some more.
After that was my third class and I had already finished thevwork.
Next I went to the kitchen and made myself lunch.
For lunch I reheated some of the chicken and vegetable soup mixed with some rice and a bowl of grapes.
Following lunch I got back on my computer for my last class of the day, which I was aoso alreafy ahead in.
Following school I video called with my mom.
My dad made me a salmon sandwich with bagles as the bread.
Then I video called my grandma.
Next I called back my mom and asked her for some help thinking up what to put in my written portion of my university application.
After I got off the phone with her I got to work filling out the application information on the university website.
Once I got to the essay part I wrote up a rough draft then called my mom for help reading it over.
It took a while, but I was finally able to finish it.
I didn’t submit it though, because I also wanted to send it to my sister to see if she had any input.
After texting her I got my dinner which was the same thing as my lunch, but my dad heated it up for me this time.
While I was about to eat I got a call from my sister.
We talked for a bit about different things.
Then I ate dinner.
Following dinner I had some rasins amd an apple for dessert.
Next I came back to my room and watched an episode of “Daria” (1997).
After that I got ready for bed and then wrote up this entry.
I stayed up to pretty much the exact same time as yesterday, which isn’t perfect, but still alright.
