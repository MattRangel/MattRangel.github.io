March 12, 2021 - Friday
In all of my classes today I didn’t really have any work.
So my school day was mostly just sitting through the video calls.
Following school I folded the clean clothes.
Then I started getting my suitcase packed for my dad and I going back to Texas for spring break.
After we both finished packing we started loading up the car and then waited for the dryer to finish.
I started off the drive.
I didn’t really sleep according to a regular schedule, so I ended up falling asleep without writing this entry.
