March 28, 2021 - Sunday
Felt like this weekend went by really fast, since I was busy driving all of yesterday.
Basically all I did today was switch between hanging out on my phone or watching the TV show “Daria” (1997).
I took some breaks from that though to eat throughout the day.
I ate a few times the first being an egg, biscuits, and some bacon.
The next thing I ate was some cereal.
Then my aunt Annette made a sandwich for me.
The last thing I ate today was some shrimp, rice, and fried plantains for dinner.
Another break I took was to wipe down the shower with some special spray for my dad.
I went to bed a late tonight, but now that I’m back home I’ll be able to get back to my schedule easier.
