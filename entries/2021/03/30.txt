March 30, 2021 - Tuesday
My school day was pretty average today.
During my lunch break I had some reheated pasta from yesterday, then a bowl of rice, and lastly a bowl of cereal.
Following school I just hung out in my room watching YouTube and chatting with friends.
One of the videos I watched was a guy explaing a ton of different music genres.
For dinner my dad made pork, yellow rice, and fried plantain.
During dinner my aunt Annette put on a movie, which I can’t remember the name of.
Following dinner I dad took me on a ride on the 4 wheeler.
Then I came back inside to my room to watch some more YouTube.
While I was hanging out my uncle Oscar came in and gave me some blue colored light bulbs.
I got ready for bed and went to sleep at a little better of a time than yesterday, so I’m slowly getting back to scheduel.
