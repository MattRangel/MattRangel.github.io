March 18, 2021 - Thursday
My brother and I got to my grandparents’ house a little this morning so lunch wasn’t ready yet.
While we were waiting my dad came over and asked us to help take apart the dead rosemary bush in front of the house.
After cutting it all down my brother and I started loading it into the bed of my dad’s truck.
There was too much to fit into the trash can.
Comming back inside lunch was being finished.
After eating I went over to my friend Ben’s house to hang out with him and our other friend Darious.
I drove my Dad’s truck, because he needed to go somewhere in my car.
For the first little bit at Ben’s house we just hung out in his room.
Then we went to the convenience store to get some snacks to have while we watched a movie.
The movie we ended up choosing was “Doctor Strange” (2016).
Following the movie we went outside and threw axes for a bit.
Then Ben cooked some burgers for dinner.
Shortly after dinner Darious and I left.
After dropping off Darious at his house I stopped at the store to get gas.
I also had to go pee really bad so I went inside after getting gas.
While I was in the store I bought a roll of crescent rolls for my family.
Once I got home I heated up the oven and then went on a walk to the gate with my mom.
Before leaving for the walk my dad offered to make the crescent rolls with meat and cheese.
After we got back my dad had already put the crescent rolls in the oven for me.
So I went to my room and just hung out until they were ready to be taken out of the oven.
Then I had to wait a bit for them to cool down before having one.
After I ate mine I went back to my room where I hung out a bit too long.
I ended up going to bed pretty late, because of how long I procrastinated going to bed.
