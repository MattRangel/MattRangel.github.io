March 13, 2021 - Saturday
My dad and I finished the road trip back to Texas this afternoon.
Our first stop was my grandparents’ house.
Then I went with my mom and brother to Sonic.
Once we got home my mom and I looked for a movie to watch.
We ended up choosing the movie “12 Years a Slave” (2014).
Following the movie I went to my room and layed down in my bed on my phone.
Once it started to get late I got ready for bed.
Then I stayed up a while more until it was time to go to sleep.
