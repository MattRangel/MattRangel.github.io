March 8, 2021 - Monday
Today after school was a pretty relaxed day.
For lunch I heated up some rice, beans, and steak.
Then I had a bowl of cereal.
Following my last class of the day I hung out on my phobe for a while.
Then I watched the show “Daria” (1997).
Once my aunt got back home I went to the store with her while she got some things for dinner.
After we got back I went back to watching TV.
For dinner we had rice, beans, and chicken.
Following dinner I had an apple for dessert.
Then I hung out in my room some more until it was my turn to take a shower.
After my shower I got ready for bed.
Once I finished I had some time still left before I had to go to bed.
I spent the first chunk of that on my phone.
Then I watched one more episode of Daria before going to sleep.
