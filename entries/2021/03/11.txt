March 11, 2021 - Thursday
My school day was pretty simply today.
I was able to finish the last of my school work in my classes.
During my last class I ate lunch.
For lunch I reheated the fried rice from last night and also had a bowl of cereal.
After school was over I headed over to my volunteer job at the thrift store.
Over there today I vacuumed and then they showed me how to use the register.
After the thrift store closed I headed home.
Once I got home I ate some grapes and two chicken wings.
Then I went to my room to hang out.
I wasn’t in there for long when my dad asked me to come along with him to my Uncle Miguel’s house.
The drive was long.
Once we got there my dad chatted for a bit and then Miguel gave us some things to give to my grandparents.
On our way back home my dad stopped at a Peruvian restaurant which was good, but I ate a little too much.
Once we got home I got ready for bed right away and then went to sleep.
We got home pretty late, so I went to bed at a not so great time again tonight.
