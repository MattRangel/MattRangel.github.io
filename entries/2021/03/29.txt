March 29, 2021 - Monday
Today was my first school day back in Florida getting back from Texas.
I ate lunch during my last period of the day.
My lunch was a can of SpaghettiOs and half a kit kat candy bar.
Since it was short school day today after school I headed over to my volunteer job.
I left a little later than normal talking to my mom on the phone.
I still got there ahead of time like I usually do though.
Today I just did my regular tasks of looking at donated items to the thrift store as well as checking people out.
After I finished for the day I sat in my car and ate a granola bar.
Eating in my car combined with me having to get gas caused me to get home later than I usually do.
Once I got home I ate some rasins and then went to my room while I waited for dinner.
In my room I just hung out on my phone watching YouTube and going through social media.
For dinner my Aunt made spaghetti and meatballs with some toasted bread as well.
Following dinner I went back to my room for the night until it was time to get ready for bed.
I wanted to watch a movie or at least a few tv show episodes, but I didnâ€™t really feel like pulling anything up.
I did go on a mini search for new music towards the end of the night which was nice.
I went to bed late again tonight.
