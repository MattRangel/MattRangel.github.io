March 3, 2021 - Wednesday
Today was one of my short school days.
In addition to that I also didn’t have to join any video calls, because there was testing going on at the school.
I still finisjed working for the day a pretty much the exact same time I would’ve normally though, but I do think I got more work done.
After school I headed up some leftover chicken soup and pasta.
Following lunch I called with my mom to say hello to her.
Then I called with my bank to ask for them to send me a bank statement.
I needed that in order to get my ID next week.
After that I went outside and video called with my grandparents.
Then I tried to call my sistee, but she was busy working.
Then I came back inside and watched the movie “The Wave” (2008) off the TV.
Later on my dad asked me to take the clean clothes out of the dryer.
While I folded the clothes I watched the TV show “Daria” (1997).
The internet was giving me problems, but as a temporary solution I was able to connect my raspberry pi to my school laptop with an ethernet cable.
For dinner my dad made scallops, fish, asparagus, and rice.
Following dinner I got ready for bed.
I was going to watch some more TV after that, but it was already late so I finished getting ready for bed then went to sleep.
I went to bed a little bit passed my target time, but still an alright time.
