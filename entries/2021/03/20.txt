March 20, 2021 - Saturday
This morning I drove my grandparents to get their second dose of Covid 19 vaccine.
After we got back to their house my grandma made an arepa and eggs for breakfast.
Following breakfast I switched between watching YouTube and napping for a while.
For lunch my grandma made another arepa and my dad made some steak.
Following luch I started watching the movie “Battle Royale” (2000).
In the middle of watching the movie I took a pause to eat some fruit.
I had some pineapple, orange, and grapes.
The orange was too sour for me, because some sour candy I had messed with my tongue.
After I finished my movie I headed back home with my brother.
Once I got home I went on a walk with my mom.
Then we watched the movie “A Bridge Too Far” (1977).
The movie was pretty long, so by the time it was over it was already about time to get ready for bed.
I did good at getting ready for bed right away, but then I got distracted working on my mom’s laptop.
Her laptop isn’t turning on properly, and I was going to look at it tomorrow, but I ended up taking it apart tonight.
It turns out that the hard drive is no good, so my mom is going to call the warranty people.
After I finished putting my mom’s computer back together I wrote this entry up.
Then I finally went to sleep at a not so great time.
