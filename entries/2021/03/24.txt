Today was my brother’s birthday!
I had a long school day, but I still went through it with ease.
After I finished school for the day I watched the movie “Apocalypto” (2006).
I paused the movie half way through once my brother and mom came over.
For my brother’s birthday lunch my grandma made tacos.
After eating I put on the movie “Ferris Bueller's Day Off” (1986).
A little into the movie I paused it for us to all sing happy birthday and eat dessert.
Dessert was cake and ice cream.
I didn’t have any of the cake because I don’t like that.
Then we opend gifts.
After that I put the movie back on.
Half way through the movie my grandma, brother, and I opened up a coconut and ate it.
After finishing the movie my mom and brother headed back home.
I went to my room and finished watching the movie “Apocalypto” (2006).
A little while after that I took a shower and then ate dinner.
For dinner I just had the same thing as I did for lunch.
Following dinner I went back to my room again until it started to get late.
Then I got ready for bed and went to sleep.
