March 6, 2021 - Saturday
Woke up from a long dream this morning but I was too tired to write it down.
After getting out of bed and brusing my teeth I ate breakfast.
For breakfast my aunt Annette made pancakes, grits, ham, bacon, and eggs.
After breakfast my dad and I brought a mirror into the bathroom so I could shave.
Once I finished shaving we started getting ready to go see aunt Jenny, uncle Juan, cousin Matias, and aunt grandma Lucy.
Before going to their house my stopped at a Colombian market, but it was closed.
We also got some fruit cocktail.
Then we were on our way.
First we stopped at Lucy’s house, but she was already at my cousin’s house.
Once we got there I said hello to everyone then hung out with Matias doing various things.
We played cards, built some structures, and drove his remote controlled car.
For dinner we had shrimp alfredo pasta.
Then for dessert there was flan.
After that we all looked at family photos.
Later on I had a bowl of cereal with Matias.
I was the one who drove on the way back home.
Once I got to my room I called my brother.
He was already on a call with our cousin Dagan, so he added me to their call.
After it started getting late I had to get off.
Then I brushed my teeth and got all ready for bed.
I went to bed late tonight, so hopefully I won’t have to wake up early for anything.
