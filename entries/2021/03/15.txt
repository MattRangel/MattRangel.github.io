March 15, 2021 - Monday
After waking up this morning I brushed my teeth and got ready for the day.
I carried some things from my car into the house and then my brother and I went to our grandparents’ house.
There my grandma made chicken wings, vegetables, and rice for lunch.
Following lunch I headed out to hang out with my friends Ben and Darious.
First I went over to Darious’ house to pick him up and then we went to Ben’s house.
At Ben’s house we threw axes in his axe throwing area.
Then we swam in the pool some, but it was cold so we stopped after a short while.
Next we came back into Ben’s room and played some computer games.
Following that we went to the convenience￼ store to get some snacks to have while we watch a movie.
The snacks we got were lots of chips and gummy rings.
The movie that we ended up chosing to watch was “Venom” (2018).
Following the movie we hung out in Ben’s room for a bit more before leaving to go hang out at Darious’ house.
At Darious’ house we played some games of pool then ate burgers.
After that Ben and I headed back and then I went home after getting back to Ben’s house.
Right when I got home I got started on getting ready for bed.
I got distracted on my phone for too long though and ended up going to bed late again tonight.
