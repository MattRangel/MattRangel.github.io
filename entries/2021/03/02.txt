March 2, 2021 - Tuesday
During my lunch break I started looking into apply for college again now that I’m actually in the house.
The cable guy also was over and so the wifi got set up during that time too.
By the time I actually went to eat there wasn’t much time left until my last class.
So I just ate some grapes and rasins.
After school I ate a real lunch of reheated pasta and chili.
Following lunch I came back to my room and just hung out on my phone and watched YouTube for a while.
I started a movie, but about a third of the way through I decided I didn’t really like it too much.
For dinner my dad made some meat and vegetable soup along with lentils and quinoa.
Following dinner I cane back to my room and started the movie “The Wave” (2008).
Bunch of things happend though and I ended up only watching the first tiny bit tonight.
First my dad called for me to help him with something on the phone.
Then I video called with my mom for a timy bit.
After that I brushed my teeth.
I was getting ready to start up the movie again when my dad asked me to help put the dirty clothes in the washer.
Then I had to take a shower.
By the time I had finished all that it was already time to go to bed, and I didn’t want to stay up late again.
