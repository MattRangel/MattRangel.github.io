March 23, 2021 - Tuesday
Today was my first day back to school after spring break.
My school day was a short schedule one, which made going back a little more easy.
I also didn’t really have any super difficult work which was nice.
Following my school day I hung out on my phone until lunch was ready.
For lunch my grandma made shrimp, rice, mashdpotatoes, vegetables, and some macaroni from last night.
After lunch I went back to my room and watched YouTube videos for a bit.
Then I took a nap since I didn’t go to bed at such a great time last night and was still a little tired.
Following my nap I ate some fruit that my grandma gave to me.
Then I drove to my brother’s school to pick him up and bring him over to our grandparents’ house.
After getting back I hung out on my phone for a while more before switching to watching a movie.
The movie I watched today was called “Perfume: The Story of a Murderer” (2006).
I paused the movie half way through to take a shower and then eat dinner.
For dinner I just had the same thing as I had for lunch.
After finishing the movie I helped my grandma hang up some balloons around the house for my brother’s birthday tomorrow.
Then I got all ready for bed and went to sleep.
