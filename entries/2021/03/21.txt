This morning I helped my mom call the warranty people about her laptop hard drive not working.
After that I ate the breakfast my dad made, which was egg, bacon, grits, bread, and a little bit of steak.
Right after that my mom and I went out to meet our friends Kristen and Audrey at Sonic.
Following sonic my mom and I headed back home.
Soon after I got home I went out again to my grandparents’ house to work on their car with my dad.
While my dad was fixing their car I also filled up some tanks of gas and went to the hardware store for my dad.
After we finally finished working on the car my mom came over to my grandparents’ house and picked me up.
She was already close to me having just dropped my brother off at church school.
I went to the store with my mom and then we hung out in the parking lot and listened to my music until it was time to pick up my brother.
After picking up my brother we stopped at another grocery store for my brother to get something to eat.
Once I got back home I hung out in my room for a tiny bit before getting started on the dishes.
In the middle of doing the dishes I took a pause to eat the dinner my dad made.
He made a steak sandwich.
Following dinner I sat with my mom and talked with her for a while.
After that I got back to doing the dishes.
Once the dishes were finished I got ready for bed.
Then I set up my mom’s old computer for her, so she’d be able to use it temporarily.
Next I got all my clothes packed up to take to my grandparents’ house for the week.
I went to bed pretty late and I’m going to have to wake up early tomorrow, but hopefully I’ll be able to sleep some more during the day.￼
