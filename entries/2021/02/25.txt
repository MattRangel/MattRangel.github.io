February 25, 2021 - Thursday
For a good while this morning I thought today was Wednesday, I even labled yesterday incorrectly.
During my art class we had a guest speaker talk about the museum she works at.
During my last class of the day I was already done with the work, so I just hung out.
For lunch I had a croissant and some peperoni thing.
While I ate lunch my dad, aunt, and uncle all left to go get another truck load of things from the old house.
For the first little bit of my day after lunch I just hung out in my room.
Then I got started on unpacking my clothes into my dresser.
While I did that I called with my mom.
Then I got my dad and I’s dirty clothes and folded them all
After I finished I called with my grandparents.
Next I just went back to hanging out until they all got back.
Once they got back I helped bring in some things from the truck.
Then I ate dinner.
For dinner my dad bought some chicken tenders and my aunt reheated rice and beans.
Following dinner my aunt and I pulled out a TV from the truck.
I pulled out my computer to watch a movie, but they all ended up being too tired.
I ate a bowl of ice cream and some golden rasins for dessert.
Since it was just me watching the movie I changed it to one called “Free Solo” (2018).
After the movie I got ready for bed.
Watching that whole movie put me going to bed very late.
