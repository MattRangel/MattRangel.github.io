School was easy todayday.
For lunch I reheated an arepa.
I had my new raspberry pi coming in the mail today, so I kept checking the tracking.
I shipped it to the new house, because I wasn’t sure how long it’d take.
So I had to wait until night time to get it.
Throughout the day I worked on my computer setting up things like kodi.
Once my dad came home with my package I opened it up and got right to work setting it up.
My mom and brother called me while I was doing that.
Then my dad made steak, lentils, and rice for dinner.
While I ate I watched a movie with my dad and uncle Oscar.
I did good at brushing my teeth before hanging out, but I ended up getting distracted and staying up way too late.
I was reading about computer things for my raspberry pi.
