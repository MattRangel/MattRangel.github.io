February 14, 2021 - Sunday
I didn’t go with my dad, uncle, and aunt to work on the house.
Instead I stayed back for today.
For pretty much the entire day I worked on my computer.
I was so deep into what I was doing that I didn’t even eat until the afternoon.
On my computer I was researching and installing a different operating system.
For lunch I just had left overs.
While I ate I talked on the phone with my mom and brother.
After lunch I got right back to work on my computer.
Later on I moved from my room to the living room and watched YouTube on TV while I worked on my computer.
Once they all got back home dinner was made.
For dinner my dad made tacos with refried beans, cheese, and chicken.
Then I went back to work on my computer some more.
My uncle Oscar heated me up a mini apple pie with ice cream for dessert.
Once I felt done with my computer for the night I went to the bathroom and got ready for bed.
After that I stayed up a little bit more, which would’ve been fine, but I didn’t write this entry first.
So I stayed up a tiny bit later than I should have, but still not too bad.
