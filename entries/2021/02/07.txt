February 7, 2021 - Sunday
I woke up late this morning since I went to bed late and I’ve been sleeping kind of irregularly.
Once I was up I went and sat down in the living room.
I put some soccer on TV and just hung out on my phone.
My aunt Annette made me an arepa for breakfast.
By the time she finished my dad and uncle Oscar had gotten back home from working at the new house.
After I ate my breakfast I went to my room and hung out on my phone and rested some more.
Later on I came back out to the living room and hung out there.
My dad and uncle left to go do some things.
Theb my aunt looked for something to put on the TV and ended up choosing a movie she liked called “Meet the Parents” (2000).
After that movie we watched the part 2 called “Meet the Fockers” (2004).
During the second movie we had dinner of meat, beans, and rice which was all really good.
Then I had dessert of ice cream and oreos which my dad had gone and bought.
Towards the end of the movie my dad finished making some rice pudding which I had as a second dessert.
Once the movie was over I hung out in my room for a little bit before getting ready for bed.
After I got ready for bed I updated my Selective Service address.
Then I spent a little more time awake before finally going to bed.
Went to bed a little late, but not extreamly so as long as I do good the rest of the week I’ll be fine.
