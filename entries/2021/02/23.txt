February 23, 2021 - Tuesday
My school day today was pretty easy.
I had work to do, but none of it was super difficult.
After school I had a sandwich that my aunt Annette made for me aswell as some reheated soup from last night.
Following school I just watched the TV show “Daria” (1997) for a while.
Later on I put on the documentary “The Ringmaster” (2019).
After the movie I ate an orange.
Then I watched some more “Daria”.
Next I started watching the movie “Carlito’s Way” (1993), but had to pause it to eat dinner.
Then my dad got back home, so I drove to the gas station and then to the store with him.
We got some SpaghettiOs for me to have tomorrow, because he said I’ll be moving to the new house tomorrow morning before school.
He also got me an ice cream bar which I ate in the car.
Once we got back home I started watching the movie I started earlier again.
I took a couple pauses during the movie again.
First to have half a banana nut muffin.
Next my dad was telling me that I’ll be moving to the new house tomorrow after school instead, so I wont have to wake up so early.
Lastly to get ready for bed, so I got go to sleep right after finishing the movie.
And that’s what I did after finishing the movie.
It was still pretty late, but would’ve been much later if I had let myself get distracted.
