February 16, 2020 - Tuesday
My school day dragged on for a while today, but it was still pretty easy.
For lunch my aunt Annette made me a tuna sandwich.
After school I messed with my raspberry pi trying to get it all set up.
That’s pretty much all I did the whole day.
For dinner we all had leftovers from yesterday.
After dinner I was going to watch a tv show on my raspberry pi, but it didn’t work out.
I’ll be working on it more tomorrow.
I went to bed a little late, but not nearly as late as yesterday which is good.
