February 24, 2021 - Tuesday
My school day today was pretty average.
I even got ahead in three of my classes.
During one of my classes I worked on packing up some of the things I had out on the floor like coords and my raspberry pi computers.
For lunch my aunt Annette headed me up some left over pork and rice.
After school I hung out for a tiny bit before going out of my room to help my dad, uncle, and aunt pack all their things into a moving truck.
I started off by moving my own things into my car.
Then I helped move their things.
After we were all done for the day I got the keys to the new house since I’d get there first.
On my drive to the new house I just listened to all of my music on shuffle.
Towards the end of the drive I switched the music to a RiFF RAFF album.
Once I got to the house I looked around then set down my wallet and things in my room.
Then I grabbed my skateboard and did that for a little bit while I waited for everyone else to get to the house.
The next person to get there was my dad driving the moving truck.
As he was trying to back it into the driveway the truck got stuck in a big rut.
Once my uncle Oscar got there he tried to use his car to pull the truck, but it wasn’t powerful enough.
Then a neighbor offered to try and help with his truck.
Our neighbor’s truck was luckily very strong and was able to get the moving truck unstuck.
For dinner my aunt ordered chinese food.
I chose cococut chicken, which didn’t really taste like anything, but the sauce felt weird in my mouth.
Then my dad and I put together my bed in my new room.
After that I brought in all my things from my car into my room.
Next I took a shower and then brushed my teeth and got ready for bed.
I also video called with my mom amd brother for a little bit.
Tonight I went to bed late, but tonight it was because I was doing things so it’s fine.
