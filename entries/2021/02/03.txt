February 3, 2021 - Wednesday
I woke up bright and early to my alarm for the first time in a while this morning.
After brushing my teeth I sat down on the bed and did my first day of school at my new school in Florida.
Once of my classes I accidentally missed, because I wasn’t in a group and couldn’t join the class call.
I was able to get into my other two classes though.
It doesn’t seem like I’m going to have much more work than I did at my old school, but I’m not going to be able to work ahead like I was before since this school does online school differently.
Once I got to my lunch period I made myself some oatmeal and watched TV.
Then I went back to my computer to finish my last class of the day, but it turned out that I had my schedule mixed up and I was actually already done for the day.
After that I went back out to the living room and watched tennis on TV and went on my phone during the commercials.
Later on I looked for a movie to watch, and once I found one I paused it to go heat up some chinese rice.
While my food was heating up I decided to wash the dishes for my aunt Annette.
By the time I finished washing the dishes I didn’t really feel like watching a movie anymore, so I just watched TV and went on my phone.
Once I finished my chinese rice I also ate a really good red orange that my grandma packed for me when I left for Florida a few days ago.
After a while my uncle Oscar and my dad got back home from working followed by my aunt a little after.
Then I ate dinner which my aunt had ordered for us all.
While I ate I just kept watching TV.
I ended up watching that same show “Impractical Jokers” (2011) all the way until I decided to go to bed.
Towards the end I wasn’t really watching and was more just on my phone though.
I went to bed a little late for a school night, but hopefully I’ll get better once I’m used to it again soon.
