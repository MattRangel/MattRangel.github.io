February 12, 2021 - Friday
Today like yesterday was a pretty easy.
I had little work to do since I was already finished in most of my classes.
During my lunch break I got distracted playing sodoku not leaving a bunch of time to eat.
My aunt heated me up a slice of pizza which I barely finished before I had to get back on my computer for class.
After school I rode with my aunt Annette to her warehouse, so she could look for something.
While I was there I dug in my box of things and grabbed some electronic things.
After the warehouse we stopped at a pet store and then the grocery store.
Once we got back home my uncle Oscar showed me his RC car and then his drone.
Comming back inside I started working on the electronics that I brought back from the warehouse.
I was looking at and running an operating system I had been reading about.
I played some games on it with my uncle, but the controller wasn’t too good , so we didn’t play for long.
After I finished with that we all watched one of the movies my aunt rented called “Greenland” (2020).
Following the movie I got ready for bed, but I didn’t actually go to bed until a while later.
That’s because I got distracted going down a research rabbit hole looking for a good controller.
I went to bed late tonight, so hopefully I wont have to wake up early.
