February 17, 2021 - Wednesday
Today was my short school day and I only really had work to do in my very first class.
After that I spent my second class messing with my raspberry pi computer trying to set it up.
By the time my third class came it was in a useable state to watch movies and shows.
So during that class period I started watching the TV show “Daria” (1997).
After school was done for the day I reheated some leftover steak and rice for lunch.
Then I came back to my room and used my raspberry pi to watch the movie “The Prestige” (2006).
After that movie I look for another one to watch and ended up choosing one called “No Man’s Land” (2001).
During that movie my raspberry pi started having problems.
So I had to deal with that for the next good while.
For dinner my aunt Annette made some ground beef, rice, and beans.
The ground beef had rasins in it though which I didn’t particularly￼ like.
Following dinner I finally got my raspberry pi in a working state to watch things.
I’m not totally done working on it though.
My aunt also made some frozen yogurt for dessert which I had with strawberries.
After all that I got ready for bed.
Then I watched a little bit more of the movie I started earlier.
It was kind of late though, so I wasn’t able to finish the whole movie.
Once I was done watching though I did a good job at not staying up any later.
I went to bed late tonight, but still better than the last two days which is good.
