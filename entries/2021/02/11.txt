February 11, 2021 - Thursday
Today was my shorter school day schedule￼.
In addition to that I also only had work to do in my very first class, so after that all I had to do was sit through the calls.
After school I heated up the chinese food from last night for my dinner.
Then I sat in the living room and finished watching the TV show “Wonderfalls” (2004).
I started the show a while ago, but got distracted from finishing the last couple episodes for a while.
After that show I watched the movie “Ocean’s Eleven” (2001).
Following that movie I watched another one called “The Thing” (1982).
During that movie my aunt Annette finished making frito pie for dinner.
While I was watching the movie my dad and uncle Oscar got home from working on the new house.
After finishing the movie my uncle recommended another one called “Hannibal Rising” (2007).
During that movie my dad made some bread pudding which I had along with some ice cream.
Once the movie was over I right away got ready for bed.
I stayed up a little more after that, but still went to sleep at a pretty good time.
