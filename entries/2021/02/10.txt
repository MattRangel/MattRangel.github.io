The first part of my school day was once again pretty easy.
For lunch my aunt Annette made me some arepas.
After lunch I got back on my computer to do my last class of the day.
I finished that one pretty easily as well.
I’m getting into the flow of my classes now which is good.
After school I went out to the living room to hang out.
I look for thing to watch on YouTube on the TV, but I couldn’t find anything so I ended up moving back to my room.
For dinner my dad made chinese rive, steak, and also reheated some beans from yesterday.
After dinner I had an oreo and an oatmeal rasin cookie.
I was going to go on a bike ride with my uncle Oscar after dinner, but I think we both ended up getting tired.
Then I went and got ready for bed and took a shower.
Next I chatted with friends on my phone for a bit.
After that I watched the movie “Lost in Translation” (2003).
The movie ended right about when I needed to go to sleep, so I wrote this up and then went to bed.
