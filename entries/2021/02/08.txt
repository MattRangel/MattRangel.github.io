February 8, 2021 - Monday
I was pretty tired waking up this morning.
I also had some dreams that disoriented me at first right after waking up.￼
After I got ready for the day I logged into my first class of the day.
All my classes before lunch went pretty smooth.
For lunch I made myself some oatmeal and heated up a couple arepas from yesterday.
Following lunch I had my last class of the day, which for the first chunck of I wasn’t really understanding.
Once I got what we were doing figured out though it was pretty fun.
After school I went out to the living room and hung out there on my phone for a while.
I went to my to rest some.
Later on I came back out to the living room.
For dinner we had a combination of different leftovers from the past few days.
After dinner I went back to my room for the night.
Once it started getting close to time for bed I got ready to go to bed and took a shower.
I stayed up a little bit more and then went to sleep.
Tonight I did pretty good at going to bed on time.
