This school week has gone by fast.
I had work in most of my classes today except for one where I was finished so I just watched TV.
For lunch my aunt Annette had made some arepas.
After school I watched a few more episodes of “Daria” (1997)
Then I watched the movie “In the Name of the Father” (1993).
I took a pause from the movie in the middle to eat pot pie which my aunt made for dinner.
Once I finished the movie I brushed my teeth and got ready for bed.
Then I watched another movie called “Midnight Run” (1988).
After that movie it was a little bit past my bed time I shoot for, but I went to bed right away so that’s pretty good.
