February 28, 2021 - Sunday
After waking up and brushing my teeth this morning I cane back to my room and hung out on my phone for a while.
Then my aunt Annette made a breakfast of muffins, bacon, ham, potatoes, and eggs.
Following breakfast I helped my uncle Oscar work outside cleaning and organizing the garage.
Once we came in around lunch time I ate an apple.
We were done working in the garage for the day, so I went back to hanging out in my room.
Soon after my dad came back home from the hardware store and made lunch for me.
He rebeated some chili and cooked some hotdogs.
Following lunch I came back to my room.
I wanted to watch a movie on my phone, but didnâ€™t want to get interrupted by having to go work some more.
So for a while I was just watching YouTube until I eventually put on a documentary.
In the middle of watching that my aunt finished making dinner so I took a pause.
For dinner my aunt made chicken, pasta, and some garlic bread.
Once I went back to my room I finished watching the documentary.
I video called with my brother and mom.
Then I later took a shower and got ready for bed.
I stayed up a little bit too late, but still better than the last few days.
