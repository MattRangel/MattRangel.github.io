February 2, 2021 - Tuesday
I spent this morning trying to get a hold of people from my new school trying to get my school books and computer.
After I finally sorted it all out I just had to wait for someone to call me back and say everything was ready to be picked up.
Shortly after I did get the call I hit the road.
After I picked up my things from school I went back to my car and ate the sandwhich that my aunt Annette made for me.
Once I got back home I just hung out on my phone for the next little while, because I was too tired to watch a movie.
After my dad and uncle Oscar got back home from working on the new house we ate dinner.
For dinner my aunt cooked Shepherd￼’s Pie.
Then we watched the movie “Cold Comes the Night” (2013).
Before the movie my aunt made vanilla ice cream and my dad went and bought ice cream and oreos to go with it.
Following the movie I got ready for bed and took a shower.
I took a little while to actually go to bed after that, but I still went to bed at a better time than yesterday.
