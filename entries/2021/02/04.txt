February 4, 2021 - Thursday
I was pretty tired after waking up this morning, but I still woke up to my alarm fine.
After getting my teeth brushed I sat back down on the bed and pulled up all my classes for the day.
My schoolday today was a little longer, because I didn’t have an off period at the end of my dad like yesterday.
I am getting more situated into all my classes and hopefully by next week I’ll be good.
During my last class of the day my aunt Annette brought me some Taco Bell for lunch.
I was going to eat it after that last class, but it felt like it was going on forever.
After school I was still kind of tired, so I just hung out in my room for a while.
For dinner my aunt made beef stew and rice.
After finishing my dinner I had a bowl of ice cream.
We were all watching a movie, but I decided to get ready for bed after that, because I didn’t want to stay up too late and I had already seen the movie.
Once I was ready for bed there was still quite a bit of time left before I actually had to go to bed.
During that time I moved my dad and I’s clothes from the washing machine to the dryer.
Then I watched YouTube until it was time for me to sleep.
I went to bed right on time tonight, and hopefully I’ll keep doing so.
