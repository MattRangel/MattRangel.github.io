February 21, 2021 - Sunday
This morning  my dad woke me up bright and early to go work on the house.
On our way there we stopped at the hardware store to get a few things.
At the house my first job was bleaching the cement.
Then I helped my dad some with painting, taping, and vacuuming.
Once we got back home it was already late in the afternoon.
My dad took a shower first and the pizza for dinner was delivered.
I waited until after I took my shower to eat dinner.
After dinner I watched the movie “Enemy at the Gates” (2001).
During the movie I had another slice of pizza and an orange.
Following the movie my mom and brother called with me for a bit.
Then I got ready for bed.
After that I procrastinated writing this up and ended up going to bed a little late.
Tomorrow I’m going to have to call the DMV to look into transferring my license, and so I’m not really looking foward to having to do that.
