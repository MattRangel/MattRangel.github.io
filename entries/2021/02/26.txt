This morning I had trouble getting my school computer to connect to my phone hotspot, but luckily my personal laptop worked fine.
In my frist class I had a test and then I had to draw a comic.
During my next class I was already ahead, but I just kept working ahead some more anyways.
After that was English class, which I didn’t really do anything in since I already finished the work.
Then it was my lunch break.
For lunch I made myself a sandwich and also a can of SpaghettiOs.
The situation in my last class of the day was pretty similar to my second class this morning.
I was already ahead in the class and probably could’ve taken a break, but I just moved further ahead instead.
Following school I got in the truck with my dad and uncle Oscar to go pick up a truck of things from the old house.
On our way there we stopped at a food truck and I got a sandwich with brisket, bacon, fried cheese, bbq sauce, and coleslaw.
There was still a bit of stuff at the house when we got there, but my aunt Annette had been working on it which made it less work.
After we loaded up both cars all the way there were still a few things left, so my aunt will have to come back tomorrow.
I offered to go with her so we’ll see if that ends up happening.
Once we got back home I helped bring in all the things out of the truck.
Then I went to my room and just hung out on my phone until dinner was ready.
For dinner my dad made some chili.
After dinner I went back to hanging out in my room.
I wanted to watch a movie, but by the time I felt like it the time was too late.
So I got ready for bed and then went to sleep.
I only went to bed a little bit better than yesterday which isn’t too great, but I don’t have to wake up early so it’ll be fine.
