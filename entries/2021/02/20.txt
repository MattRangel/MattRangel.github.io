February 20, 2021 - Saturday
I woke up a bit late this morning.
For my lunch I reheated some of the beans from dinner yesterday and also had an orange.
Then I went back to my room for a while until my Aunt Barbie came over with some pastries.
She had to go to the store and as she was leaving my aunt Annette came back home.
For the next little while I sat out in the living room.
I hooked up my raspberry pi computer to the TV and messed around with that.
I folded my dad and I’s clothes and facetimed with my mom and brother while I did that.
For dinner my aunt Annette made pork, yuca, rice, and beans.
While we all ate dinner I pulled up the movie “Wonder Woman 1984” (2020) for them.
After the movie I got ready for bed and then hung out awake for a while.
I went to bed late again tonight, because I got distracted watching health videos ok YouTube by this channel I just found.
I also called with my mom again for a little bit before finally going to sleep.
