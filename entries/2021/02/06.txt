February 6, 2021 - Saturday
I woke up late this morning.
Once I was up I watched cartoons on TV with my uncle Oscar.
My aunt Annette made me some waffles and bacon for breakfast.
Then my uncle and I watched some YouTube until he and my aunt had to leave to go work ok their new house.
I kept watching YouTube after they left.
For lunch I had a yogurt and a slice of pizza from yesterday.
I called with my grandparents, brother, and mom all separately.￼
After my aunt and uncle got back I kept watching YouTube.
Later on my dad came back home with some pastries.
For dinner my aunt cooked chicken and rice.
Following dinner my uncle and I went on a bike ride.
We were also going to play tennis, but he couldn’t find a second racket.
The bike ride was pretty long and wore me out, but I never got super exhausted which made it fun.
Once we got back I took a shower abd then ate dessert.
Then we all watched the movie “One False Move” (1992).
After the movie I took a long time to get ready for bed.
Once I finally finished getting ready for bed I took another long time to actually go to bed.
