February 22, 2021 - Monday
My school day today was pretty average.
During lunch I tried to call the DMV to ask about transferring my drivers license, but the wait was too long so I just made the appointment.
After school I watched some of the TV show “Daria” (1997) for a bit.
Then I went with my dad to the store so he could get some things for dinner.
We also got some grapes that I asked for.
At home I ate an orange then started the movie “Gattaca” (1997).
I paused the movie half way through to have dinner.
My dad made soup for dinner.
After the movie I got ready for bed then watched another episode of “Daria”.
I ended up staying up a while after that, which put me going to bed kind of late.
