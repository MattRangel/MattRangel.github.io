February 19, 2021 - Friday
After finishing my first class the rest of my school day was pretty easy.
After school I ate the chicken salad sandwich my aunt Annette mafe fkr me for lunch.
Then I watched some more episodes of “Daria” (1997).
Later on I went to run some errands with my aunt.
We went to a place for her to get alcohol for herself, my dad and uncle first.
Then we went to the grocery store.
By the time we got back my dad and uncle Oscar had already gotten back home.
I sat at in the living room talking with them for a while.
Then I came back to my room until it was time for dinner.
For dinner my aunt made chickpeas with some other things.
After dinner I quickly went to the store to grab some brownies and ice cream for my uncle and I.
There were no brownies, so I got mini pies instead.
Once I got back we put the pies in the oven and started one of the movies my aunt rented called “Fear of Rain” (2021).
The time I finished the movie was fine, but where I went wrong was not getting ready for bed right after.
I ended up putting it off a long time and went to bed pretty late.
