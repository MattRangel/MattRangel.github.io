February 27, 2021 - Saturday
This morning for breakfast I had an egg sandwich.
It was originally my uncle Oscar’s but he forgot it before leaving and my dad said I could have it.
Following breakfast I went back to my room and hung out on my phone for a bit.
Then my dad called for me to come help him.
And so that’s what I did for the rest of the mornibg and well into the afternoon.
Our main focus today was working on the kitchen taping it off in preperation to paint and also cleaning and fixing the stove.
I got a micro break when I had to drive to Publix to buy paper towels.
For lunch I had some left over pizza reheated in the oven.
Later on I went to Publix again with my Aunt Annette while she get a few things.
For dinner we had pot pie which my aunt had made.
After dinner I put some new bulbs in around the house with my uncle.
Then we watched the movie “The Belko Experiment” (2016).
During the movie I had some of the cheese cake my aunt made.
Following the movie I got ready for bed.
Then I stayed up a tiny bit more before going to bed.
I went to bed a little earlier than yesterday again, but still not a super great time
