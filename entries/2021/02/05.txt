February 5, 2021 - Friday
This morning I woke up bright and early for my third day of my new Florida school.
All my classes went smooth and I’m getting used to going tobschool again.
In my art class I drew a photo, which was fun since I haven’t practiced in a while.
After school I went out to the living room and watched YouTube on TV with my uncle Oscar.
While I was watching TV I made myself a tuna sandwich with the tuna that my aunt Annette made for me.
Later on my uncle and aunt both had to leave for a little bit to do work at their warehouse.
While they were gone I kept watching YouTube, and then ended up falling asleep.
Once they got back I watched some more TV with my uncle until my aunt left to go get dinner.
After she left we shot the cross bow and messed with his go pro figuring out the slow motion.
For dinner my aunt came back with a jumbo pizza.
Following dinner we started a movie that I found, but it ended up not being too good so we took it off.
Then my aunt found one called “The Trial of the Chicago 7” (2020).
After the movie I got ready for bed and then went to sleep.
I went to bed a little late, but not super late and I don’t have to wake up early so it’ll be fine.
