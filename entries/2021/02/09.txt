February 9, 2021 - Tuesday
My school day was pretty easy today.
All the work in each of my classes was pretty straight foward.
After school I ate a sandwich for lunch that my aunt Annette made for me.
For pretty much the rest of the day I was just in the living room watching YouTube.
For dinner my aunt Annette made chicken and lentils.
Following dinner I went back to my room and hung out on my phone there for the rest of the night.
Right before getting ready for bed I tried to help my uncle Oscar set up an endoscope to work with his tablet, but the endoscope was old and didnâ€™t work with it too well.
After getting ready for bed I stayed up a tiny bit more.
Tonight I went to bed kind of late.
