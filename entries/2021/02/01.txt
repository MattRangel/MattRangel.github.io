February 1, 2021 - Monday
This morning I stayed home again and didn’t go work woth my dad and uncle Oscar, because I was waiting to hear back from my new school about my enrollment.
So eventually I got an email back saying I was enrolled, so I just needed to schedule an appointment to pick up my school computer.
I wasn’t able to get a hold of the person I needed to set the appointment with, but someone else told me that they’d be able to talk with me tomorrow morning.
After that I was done having to keep looking for new incoming emails.
I watched the movie “A Fistful of Dollars” (1964).
Then I looked for something to watch on cable and ended up just putting on the show “Impractical Jokers” (2011).
While I was watching that my aunt Annette finished making dinner.
So I ate the chicken and Chinese rice she made.
Once my dad and uncle got home my uncle put on the movie “Ben” (1972).
Towards the end of that movie my aunt made some homemade ice cream again.
This time we all kind of decided that it was not very good.
It was made of chocolate almond milk, syrup, and cashews all blended together.
Then I looked for a movie too watch for a while, but never ended up finding one that sounded good abd that they hadn’t seen.
That might’ve been for the best though, because I did end up going to bed a little bit earlier than I have been lately.
