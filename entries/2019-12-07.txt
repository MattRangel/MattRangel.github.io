This morning I went to the car place to get my tires rotated.
In-between that and going to drop my brother off at a birthday party later in the night, today was a pretty average hang around the house day.
After my dad and I dropped my brother off at his party we went to my grandparents house and stayed there till my brother was done.
That kept me up later than I liked and so that’s the reason why I’m not going to bed on time today.
Although I probably still wouldn’t have gone to bed at a perfect time even if I was at home.
