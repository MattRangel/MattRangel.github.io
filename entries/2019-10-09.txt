Today I got new plans for this saturday to go see the Joker movie with two of my new friends since my previous plans for saturday got a date change.
While waiting for my dad to finish making dinner my mom and I tried to watch some TV.
First we pulled up a tv show that we had been watching the previous week, but it was moving very slowly/boringly(is that a word?).
After turning that show off I found another movie but it wasn’t too great￼ either so we didn’t finish that one either.
