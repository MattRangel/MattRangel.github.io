Today I just hung out at the house.
In the afternoon around 2 or 3pm I fell asleep and didn’t wake up till about 5:30pm.
I don’t usually take naps during the day so it was weird missing that chunk of the day.
After waking up I ate some shrimp my dad made.
Following that my parents and I drove over to Walmart to get some snacks.
Now at the end of the night I am going to bed late again, so hopefully I’ll be able to get my sleeping back to normal in two days for school haha!
