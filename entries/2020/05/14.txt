May 14, 2020 - Thursday
This morning I finished my last day of online school.
It’s going to feel weird not doing school first thing in the morning next week.
After finishing my work I layed back in bed and watched Netflix until it was time to go to my grabdoarents’ house for the day.
My grandma made gumbo for lunch today.
Following lunch I put my sister’s college graduation live stream on the TV for my grandparents, brother, and I to all watch.
Once that was over I went back to hanging out on my phone.
After I getting back home I went to my room and procrastinated brushing my teeth for a while.
I finally brushed my teeth and then I went on my walk with my mom.
Then I went to bed at a very good time for the second night in a row.
So far this is the longest streak of “going to bed on time” days I’ve had in a very long time.
