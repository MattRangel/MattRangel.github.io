May 8, 2020 - Friday
This morning I ate my breakfast outside on the patio.
I had a peanut butter sandwich, a banana, and some apple pie.
After my breakfast I went on my walk with my mom
Then I went to my room and watched the TV show “Daredevil” (2015) for a little bit.
I didn’t watch for long though, because my dad asked me to drive for him.
So for the next five and a half hours I drove my dad around to do various errands.
For lunch we got some sandwiches.
Mine was plain ham and cheese.
Once I got back home I went back to my room and switched between resting and watching more Netflix.
Then my dad called for me to come help him make the dinner.
For dinner we made ravioli which was really good.
After dinner I went back to my room and listened to some music.
I got up out of my room to brush me teeth.
Then I wrote this and went to sleep.
I am going to bed at a better time than I did yesterday.
I am also not going to set my alarm so hopefully I’ll be able to get some more sleep in.
