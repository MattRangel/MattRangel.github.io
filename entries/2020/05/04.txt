May 4, 2020 - Monday
I did my homework after waking up this morning and then threw away all the trash in the house.
Then I watched some Netflix before leaving to my grandparentsâ€™ house.
After eating over there I took a nap and then watched some more TV on my phone.
Once I got home I went on my walk with my mom.
Then I went to my room for a bit before washing the dishes.
After the dishes were done I brushed my teeth and then stayed up a little while longer watching Netflix.
