May 22, 2020 - Friday
I woke up at the exact time I want to without my alarm this morning.
After I brushed my teeth my dad made an egg sandwich.
Then I went back to my room and just hung out for a while.
For lunch I made another sandwich.
Later in the afternoon my mom invited me to come to Walmart with my brother and her.
At Walmart I bought some Hi-Chew candies.
After we were finished shopping we got dinner at Popeyes
Once we got back home my mom had my brother and I break down some boxes to recycle.
I hung out for a while and was getting the energy to get up and brush my teeth when my dad called for me.
He wanted me to help him connect the lawn mowing attachment to his tractor.
Once I finished helping him with that I came back inside and got my teeth brushed.
Then I went on a walk with my mom.
I am going to bed a little bit later than I would’ve liked, but it’s not a huge deal.
