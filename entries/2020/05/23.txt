Today was my grandmother’s birthday!
I ate some SpaghettiOs and a sliver of pie for breakfast.
Then I just hung out until it was time to go to my grandparents’ house for the celebration.
My family all got into the car and we headed over there a little after noon.
Before we went to their house we stopped at a pizza place to pick up lunch.
Once we got there we all ate pizza.
Then after everyone had finished we sang happy birthday then ate dessert.
￼For dessert there was apple pie and rice pudding.
After we did gifts my parents went to the AT&T store to get new phones for themselves.
That took a while so by the time we all finally got home it was late into the afternoon.
I still had plenty of daylight left to finish the mowing though.
Once I finished mowing I took a shower then went on a walk with my mom.
Back inside the house I helped my mom set up Face ID on her phone.
Then I ate some grapes and went back to my room.
My parents called my back out of my room for a family meeting.
They said they were going to get me a new phone too!
I think we are going to go tomorrow since they already have the green color I want in stock.
Once we finished all talking about that and some other things it was getting late.
So I got my teeth brushed and then went to bed.
The time is a little past what I would’ve liked, but it’s still in the good range.
