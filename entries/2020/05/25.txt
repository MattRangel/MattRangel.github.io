May 25, 2020 - Mobday
I woke up about 30 minutes past the time I normally do.
Once I was up I threw away all the trash in the house then just hung out.
On the drive to my grandparents’ house I let my brother play his music after he watched a funny video I wanted him to see.
At my grandparents’ house I ate lunch then lounged for a little bit before putting on a movie.
The movie I chose was “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” (2008).
After the movie I started watching this TV show called “Over the Garden Wall” (2014).
Once I got back home I got my teeth brushed and then did the dishes.
Then I went on a walk with my mom.
I came back to my room and then finished watching “Over the Garden Wall”.
After that show I spent the last little bit of my night watching the beginning of this movie called “It’s Such a Beautiful Day” (2012).
I have also been thinking about buying the same hoodie I just got but a size larger.
It turns out that I could maybe be able to return the one that doesn’t fit me, but I never really liked returning internet things because it’s kind of a hassle.
