May 10, 2020 - Sunday
Today was mother’s day.
For breakfast I ate some graham crackers and apple sauce.
Then I went on my walk with my mom.
A little while after that my family all got into the car and drove to pick up a pizza.
We brought the pizza to my grandparents’ house.
I ate my hawaiian slice then a second slice of sausage later on.
I also ate some ice cream.
I drove my dad to the store to pick up some things for my grandparents.
Once we got back it was time to go.
At home I relaxed for a little bit.
Then I finished the rest of the mowing.
I got a bad rash from the grass which stopped itching once I took a shower.
For dinner I ate a bowl of cereal, because I didn’t know my dad was planning on making something.
I helped him make the pasta and salad for dinner.
Once I finished dinner I went to my room to procrastinate doing my dishes.
After I finally got up and did then I had the energy to brush my teeth and clean my room.
So all that was left was to write this entry up and then go to bed.
