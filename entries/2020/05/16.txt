May 16, 2020 - Saturday
I finished watching the all the episodes to this show “Daredevil” that I’ve been watching on Netflix.
After I did that I watched some other shows, ate, and scrolled through my phpne for a while.
I went outside and scootered around for a bit.
I came back inside and hung out for a while more.
My brother came and asked me if I wanted to walk with him so I did.
Once we came back inside I watched the first episode of “The Twilight Zone” with him.
Then we watched the movie “The Last Samurai” (2003).
During the movie I ate some peas and noodles which my mom made for dinner.
It was a pretty long movie so I brushed my teeth and went to bed after.
I did go to bed a little bit later than I did yesterday, but not too horribly.
