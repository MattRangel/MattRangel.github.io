May 20, 2020 - Wednesday
I woke up a little bit later than I normally do since I went to bed later last night.
After I woke up I got a text from my mom asking me to sweep the house.
Sweeping took a while and once I was finished I ate some breakfast.
Then I went back to my room and watched Netflix for some time.
I helped my dad cook dinner in the afternoon.
After dinner I washed the dishes which took up a lot of time since there was so many of them.
I listened to music with my friend Sarah for a while until my dad said we are goibg to dairy queen for ice cream.
Once I got back home my dad asked me to help do some of the mowing.
So I hopped on the lawn mower and mowed the grass until it got dark.
Then I came back inside and took a shower.
Following that I went back to listening to music with Sarah for the rest of the night.
I went to bed pretty late, but I am not going let that mess me up.
