May 28, 2020 - Thursday
I woke up at my normal time this morning even though I stayed up late last night.
I watched the movie Forrest Gump with my grandparents.
I was planning to go to bed at a good time when I got home tonight.
The car was overheated because it needed coolant when I got back home.
After I did that with my dad I spent the rest of the night helping him work on the lawnmower.
When I came back inside it was already past midnight.
My phone was also on the ground when I went to grab it off the table that I set it on.
Somehow it fell off the table which caused the backside to get all cracked.
I stayed up for a while longer then went to bed very late.
