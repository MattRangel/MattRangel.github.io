May 31, 2020 - Sunday
This morning after waking up I finished watching the movie “Children of Men” (2006).
The next movie I watched was “Escape from New York” (1981).
That one I watched alone because everyone was busy doing other things.
I went back to my room for a bit after that.
A little later I came out and helped my dad cook egg rolls for lunch.
After lunch I put on another movie called “Assault on Precinct 13” (1976).
I watched this one with my mom and made us some popcorn to eat.
Following that I watched a second movie with my mom named “Children of the Corn” (1984).
During this one I ate some of the leftover egg rolls.
After that we were pretty movied out, so that was the last movie of the day for me.
I went back to hanging out in my room.
A while later my dad wanted to spray bug poison along the edge of the floors.
So I had to pick up all my things up off my floor and set them on my bed.
Once I was all done with that I was about to brush my teeth when my dad said we are going to Dairy Queen.
I was the one to drive everyone to Dairy Queen.
Once we got over there I just got a chocolate dipped ice cream cone.
Back at home I procrastinated getting ready for bed and putting my room back together for a pretty long time.
After I finally got my room cleaned and ready for bed I went to sleep.
I didn’t do too great at going to bed on time tonight. ￼
