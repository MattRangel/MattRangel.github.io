Before eating breakfast this morning I played Roblox on my computer for a little bit.
After breakfast I went on a walk with my mom.
That walk was to make up for the one that we missed yesterday.
Once we were back from the walk I went to my room where I stayed watching Netflix for a while.
I came out of my room at couple times to eat.
At some time in the afternoon I went outside and scootered around the my house.
I came back into my room for a while before going on my second walk with my mom.
Once that walk was over I got ready for bed.
Then I hung out for a while before going to bed.
Iâ€™m going to bed at a really good time tonight.
