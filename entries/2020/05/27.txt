May 27, 2020 - Wednesday
I woke up at my normal time this morning, but actually got up out of my bed sooner than I normally do because my dad texted me asking to open the gate for him.
I ended up not having to walk down there and open it though, because my mom was leaving and I was able to just ask her to leave it open for me.
For breakfast this morning I made myself a sandwich, reheated some old hotdogs, and a few crackers.
Then I went to my room and hung out for a bit.
I came out to make the rice for lunch which my dad asked me to do.
Then I went back to hanging out until my mom got home from the gym.
I watched the movie “Speed” (1994) with her.
By the time the movie was ending my dad finished making lunch.
So we all sat down to eat the wings, chicken, and rice.
After eating lunch my mom took a nap so I finished the movie by myself.
Once that movie was finished I went right to my next one which was “Good Morning, Vietnam” (1987).
My mom was awake by the time I finished that movie so I went on a walk with her.
Coming back inside my dad had a phone problem.
So I spent the next little while working on that.
Towards the end of fixing the phone I started making batches of popcorn.
My first batch was supposed to be cherry, but you couldn’t really taste the cherry so it was turned out as sugar flavor.
The second batch was just a normal bowl of popcorn with some light salt.
Then I put on another movie to watch with my mom.
It was in spanish and a fantasy movie, so I ended up changing it to something else that my mom would like more.
I ended up choosing to put on “The Firm” (1993).
When I put on that movie it was already past the time I try and go to bed at.
So by the time I finished the movie it was really late.
To add onto that I still had to get ready for bed and do the dishes.
It was way super late by the time I actually went to bed.
I’m actually very curious to see what time my brain wakes me up at tomorrow morning.
