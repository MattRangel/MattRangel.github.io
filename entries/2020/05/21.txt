May 21, 2020 - Thursday
Even though I went to bed late last night I still woke up at pretty much the same time I normally do.
I was a little tired throughout the day though.
I spent the morning before I went to my grandparents’ house watching Netflix.
Once I did get to my grandparents’ house I ate lunch then watched some more Netflix for a little bit.
Then I put on the movie “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” (1989).
After the movie I rested and listened to music and just hung out on my phone.
Right after I got back home I brushed my teeth and got ready for bed.
I had a little bit of free time before it was time for me to go to bed, so I watched some more Netflix.
The show I’ve been watching today is called “Jessica Jones”.
It’s another super hero TV show.
I am pushing back the time I choose to go to bed by an hour.
That is because I want to not get used to sleeping an extra hour.
I went to bed on time tonight.
