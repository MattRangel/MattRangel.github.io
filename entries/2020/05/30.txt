May 30, 2020 - Saturday
When I woke up this morning I was still tired, but I couldn’t fall back asleep.
For breakfast I ate a can of SpaghettiOs, cereal, and a muffin.
My dad then asked me to do the mowing.
I decided to wait until the afternoon to do that, so that way I wouldn’t be out in the sun right when it’s in the middle of the sky.
I just hung out in my room until it was time for me to mow.
I finished up all the mowing in about five hours.
Then I took a shower and ate some dinner.
My dinner was reheated mashed poatoes  and macaroni and cheese￼.
My screen protector that I ordered cane in the mail, so I put that on afterwards.
It was a cool one that lined it’s self up, so it was really simple.
Then I chilled just out for the rest of the night.
A little bit before I went to bed I helped a little with getting screen protectors on everyone elses phones.
