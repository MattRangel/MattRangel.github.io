May 9, 2020 - Saturday
For breakfast I ate leftover ravioli from last night.
Then I went to my room and watched Netflix.
After a little but my dad called called for me to come mow the grass.
So for the next four hours or so I was outside cutting the grass.
I stopped when I had to come back to refill the gas tank.
At point my dad said I could take a break.
So I went inside and took a shower.
After getting into clean clothes I ate some more ravioli then did the sweeping.
Right after I finished sweeping my dad called me again to come help him with lunch.
Once we finished cooking lunch I didn’t eat a whole bunch because I wasn’t very hungry.
A little while after lunch I drove to walmart with my mom so she could get ice cream and I could fill up some gas tanks for my dad.
Once we got back home my mom, brother, and I all tried the ice cream my mom got.
Then I went to my room and phone called with my friend Sarah for a while.
After we got off the phone we listened to some music togerher.
Then I ate some food and brushed my teeth.
I was pretty tired at this point so I wrote the up then went to bed.
