May 26, 2020 - Tuesday
I woke up a whole hour earlier than I normally do this morning.
I think it’s because I am not lacking sleep as much as I was before, or it could just be because I had to go to the bathroom haha.
Once I was up I finished watching the movie “It’s Such a Beautiful Day” (2012).
Then I rebought the hoodie I got a month or two ago but a size larger.
In the afternoon over at my grandparents’ house I watched the movie “Sorry to Bother You” (2018) after eating lunch.
After that I put on the movie “Gremlins” (1984) on the TV to watch with my grandparents.
I got tired while laying there watching the movie and so I was falling in and out of sleep for sone it.
I couldn’t settle on another movie to watch so I just watched YouTube videos for the rest of my time over there.
Once I got back home I went on a walk with my mom.
Then I got ready for bed and washed the dishes.
By the time I was done with all that I still had a little bit of time to hang out before I went to bed.
