May 17, 2020 - Sunday
Today was another lazy day of just hanging out.
I really was just switching between eating and Netflix all day today so it’s kind of just a blur of thoes two things.
So because of that this entry would be structured exactly like the other ones.
I went on my walk with my mom this morning.
We didn’t walk a second time for the one we missed yesterday, because she said that it’s up to me if I want to go with her each day now.
I still plan to continue my walks with her, but it’s nice that it’s more my choice now.
I made rice for my family to eat for dinner.
I ate my portion of rice with a scrambled egg.
The time I went to bed tonight was very good.
During the past few days I’ve still been pretty tired though.
Hoping that it’ll go away quickly once my body fully gets used to sleeping like this again.
