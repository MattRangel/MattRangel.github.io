May 18, 2020 - Monday
I was still tired when I woke up this morning, but I’m definitely starting to feel more well rested each morning.
I just hung out in my room while I waited for it to become time to leave for my grandparents’ house.
Once it was time to leave I put the garabage in the trunk and drove over there.
At my grandparents’ house I ate pasta with white sauce, chicken, and corn with string beans for lunch.
Following lunch I watched some Netflix for a while.
After a bit I put the movie “Raiders of the Lost Ark” (1981) on the TV to watch with my grandparents.
During the movie I ate some ice cream, some popcorn, and then a popsicle.
That was a bit more than I planned to eat, but it just kind of happened lol.
Once the movie was over I listened to some music for a while before taking a shower.
After my shower I ate dinner which was the same thing as I had for lunch.
When I got back home I went to my room to procrastinate doing the dishes.
After I finally got up and did the dishes I got ready for bed.
Then I went on my walk with my mom.
Once I was back from the walk I wrote a congratulations letter to my fried who just graduated.
Then I went to bed at another good time.
