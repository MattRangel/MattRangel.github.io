May 29, 2020 - Friday
This morning I woke up two hours later than I normally do, which doesn’t suprise me at all.
I didn’t eat anything for breakfast, because my dad was already in the kitchen making something.
The lunch that he made was lamb ribs, mashed potatoes, cauliflower￼, and macaroni and cheese.
Following lunch I went over to my friend Darious’ house and hung out with him and another friend Ben.
After that we all went over to Ben’s house and swam in his pool.
We stayed out in the pool all the way until it got dark.
Then we left to go home.
Once I got back home I realized that I had been hanging out for around eight hours.
I got my teeth brushed and then went to bed.
I’m going to bed at an okay time tonight, but I’ll still probably be tired tomorrow.
That’s because of the bad sleep I got the last two days combined with the fact that I was swimming for a really long time.
