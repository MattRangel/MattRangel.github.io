May 6, 2020 - Wednesday
After I got my homework finished this morning I just hung out in my room for the rest of the morning.
One of the things I did after my homework was finish working on a second website.
I really like how it turned out and it fits what I had envisioned pretty well.
At about noon I got a notification on my phone that said my necklace that I bought was delivered.
So I walked down to the mail box and opened the necklace.
Once I got back to my house I tried on the necklace with a couple different shirts.
I am pretty happy with the necklace I chose and how it looks.
For my lunch I ate half of the food my grandma gave me yesterday.
Then I went back to my room and on my phone.
Once my mom got back home from running erands we went on our walk together.
I debated for a while whether or not I wanted to eat something for dinner since I wasnâ€™t super hungry.
I ended up deciding to make some microwave ramen noodles.
Once I finished eating I washed all the dishes.
Then I got my teeth brushed and went back to my room.
I stayed up for a little while longer, but nowhere close to the time that I did yesterday.
