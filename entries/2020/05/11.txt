May 11, 2020 - Monday
Got my school work done first thing this morning.
After that I collected all the trash then hung out until it was time to go to my grandparents’ house.
Over there I did the normal of eat and watch Netflix.
Right after I got back home I brushed my teeth.
Then I went to my room and read my “Tao Te Ching” book.
After that I layed in my bed and meditated for a little bit while listening to music.
Then I got back on my phone to watch some more Netflix.
I went on my walk with my mom after a bit of that.
I came back to my room after the walk.
Once I got the energy I got up and washed the dishes and my face.
I stayed up for a little while after that, but still went to bed at an okay time.
