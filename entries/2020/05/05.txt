May 5, 2020 - Tuesday
Today was my grandpa's birthday.
After waking up this morning I did the little homework that I had.
Once I finished that up I just hung out until it was time to go to my grandparents' house.
When I got to my grandparents' house I had to wait for my parents to get their to eat since they were bringing the meat.
They didn't take too long after we got there, and so we ate.
Once we finished eating we got out the pie and ice cream.
We all sang happy birthday to my grandpa.
Shortly after we were all done eating dessert my parents got back in the car to go head back home.
My brother and I stayed there the rest of the day like we normally do.
Once I got back home I went to my room to hang out.
I did go on my walk with my mom today but that wasn't until later in the night.
After our walk I brushed my teeth and then went back to my room.
I chose to just leave the dishes for tomorrow morning since it was kind of late.
I continued working on another website that I had started on earlier in the day.
The time I went t bed was pretty late, but I doubt that I will not be able to wake up to my alarm tomorrow morning because of that.
