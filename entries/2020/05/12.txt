May 12, 2020 - Tuesday
I didn’t use my alarm to wake up this morning.
So I woke up about two hours later than I would have with my alarm.
I didn’t have too much work so I still finished it all with some time left over before I left for my grandparents’ house.
Over there I ate and watched Netflix.
Once I got back home I went to my room and hung out until my mom was ready to go on our walk.
After the walk I got back to listening to music with my friend Sarah.
I took a pause to wash the dishes then went back to music with her.
I continued that until it got pretty late and I decided to go to bed.
