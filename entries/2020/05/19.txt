I was not tired when I woke up this morning.
That’s a good sign that I’m getting adjusted to sleeping normally.
My morning at home before leaving to go to my grandparents’ house was pretty normal.
I just hung out on my phone like I normally have been.
At my grandparents’ house I ate lunch I then watched a few TV shows on my phone.
Then I came out and put on the movie “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” (1984).
After the movie I listened￼ to a new music album in with my friend Sarah.
We listened to it at the same time by just pressing play at the same moment.
After we finished that I watched some more Netflix then took a shower and ate dinner.
Once I got back home I got the dishes done and then my teeth brushed.
I then went on my walk with my mom.
Everything was done so I just hung out for the rest of the night.
I went to bed a little be later than I have been, but nothing too terrible.￼
