May 3, 2020 - Sunday
While I was eating my breakfast of microwaved taquitos my mom came and chatted with me.
After breakfast I went on my walk with her.
Once we got back from the walk I went to my room and watched some Netflix.
My dad made chicken chuleta for lunch which was good.
I looked for a chain necklace to buy and decided that a curb link style one would be cool.
I didn’t know what size I wanted though so I used a measuring tape and also asked my brother.
I ended up choosing 20in long and 10mm thick.
After I bought the necklace I actually cancelled the order, because I got worried about if the one I got was bad quality.
I looked around for different options, but ended up just rebuying it from the first person.
Then I went back to hanging out in my room.
My dad called me to come help him fix something.
That got me out of my room so once I was done helping him I washed the dishes.
There was a lot of dishes from lunch being cooked, but I finished them easily watching “Daredevil” (2015) on Netflix.
I was watching the first episode and then finished it after brushing my teeth.
After I got my teeth brushed I stayed up for a little longer before going to bed.
