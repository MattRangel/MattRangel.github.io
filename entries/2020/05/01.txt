May 1, 2020 - Friday
All this morning and a little bit into the afternoon I watched Netflix and ate every now and then.
I got sick of sitting in my room after a while and went on a walk.
After walking a couple times I called with my friend Sarah.
We took a pause so I could go on my walk with my mom.
Then we got back to the call.
Once we were done talking I watched a movie with my mom and dad, but didnâ€™t end up liking it.
So I just went to bed instead.
