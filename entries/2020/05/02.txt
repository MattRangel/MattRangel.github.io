May 2, 2020 - Saturday
This morning for breakfast I ate a peanut butter and banana sandwich.
Then I finished watching a show on Netflix.
After that I took a break from watching TV for a little bit and listened to some music.
Once the break was over I watched the movie “SLC Punk” (1998).
I listened to some more music then went on my walk with my mom.
After our walk I went to my room and hung out for a bit.
Then I watched an okay movie with my mom and brother.
It was kind of late by then so I got my teeth brushed.
I stayed up and hung out for a little while longer before going to bed.
