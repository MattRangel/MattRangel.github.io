May 13, 2020 - Wednesday
Did not have too much work to do for school this morning, but I did get distracted so it took a little longer than it should have.
After I finished working I watched some Netflix and ate some ramen for breakfast.
The rest of the morning I didn’t do much besides Netflix and snacking.
Some time during the afternoon I went to drop off trash, donations, and recycling.
There was a bunch to drop off because my parents were cleaning out the pantry.
After we finished dropping off everything my dad stopped at walmart to get us all ice cream.
Once I got back home my dad made a sandwich for dinner so I ate that.
Then I went to my room for a bot.
I came back to out to eat my ice cream, but it was still soft so I put it back in the freezer.
Since I was already up though I decided to do the dishes.
Then I went to my room and spent the rest of the night listening to music with my friend Sarah.
I went to bed at a very good time tonight.
I’m hoping that I can get my sleeping back to normal.
I’ve been starting to feel my lack of sleep wearing on me.
