May 7, 2020 - Thursday
Almost went to bed without writing today’s entry!
This morning I completed the rest of the homework I had leftover from the week.
Then I watched some Netflix on my phone before heading out to my grandparents’ house.
Over there after I ate I watched some more Netflix.
I got tired after a bit so I took a pretty long nap.
Once I woke up from the nap I hung out on my phone a bit more then took a shower.
After I showered and ate dinner I drove back home.
At home I sat in my room for a good while waiting for my mom to be ready for our walk.
Once we finally did the walk I went back to my room and listend to music with my friend Sarah for the rest of the night.
I also added a few things to a different website I’ve been working on.
I am going to bed late again tonight, but hopefully it wont mess with my mood or anything too much.
