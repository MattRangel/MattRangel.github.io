July 14, 2020 - Tuesday
I didn’t do too much this morning before going to my grandparents’ house.
After eating lunch over there I took a nap for a while.
I then tried to put on a movie for my grandparents.
The first two I tried weren’t good so I switched them off.
The third one I couldn’t get the subtitles to work.
So at that point I just quit and hung out on my phone some more.
Once I got home I got the dishes done and then brushed my teeth.
I had a little bit of time before I wanted to go to bed and ended up staying awake a while past that.
