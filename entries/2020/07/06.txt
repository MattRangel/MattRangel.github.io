July 6, 2020 - Monday
Today was mostly texting with friends and playing around on my computer.
I woke up at my normal time this morning which is probably going to lead to me being tired for the next few days.
On the drive to my grandparents house at noon I realized I forgot the trash.
I could’ve just brought it tomorrow, but I didn’t want to have to worry about rushing over there to put it in the garbage can.
Once I got over there I are lunch then just hung out for a while.
Later on in the afternoon I put on the movie “Back to the Future” (1985) to watch with my grandparents.
During the movie I ate some ice cream and microwave popcorn.
After the movie I went back to my computer and phone, but not for long because it was already about dinner time.
So I took a shower and then ate dinner.
Once I got back to my house I brushed my teeth and then got the dishes done.
I then hopped back on my computer for the rest of my night.
I didn’t go to sleep on time today due to me not caring enough and also because I got distracted from the time.
Ended up going to bed late again for the second night in a row.
Today was not nearly as late as yesterday though, so I guess thats like a half success lol.
