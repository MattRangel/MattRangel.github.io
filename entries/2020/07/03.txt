July 3, 2020 - Friday
For my breakfast this morning I ate oatmeal and some Hi-Chews.
After breakfast I got on my computer and did various things going on tangents.
I took a break from my computer for a while to watch some YouTube.
Then later in the afternoon my dad asked me to make the rice for dinner.
He made chicken wings, squash, sausage, and beans that went with that.
After dinner I got back on my computer and got started on a project that pretty much took up the rest of my time at home for the day.
I did take a pause to go eat ice cream with my family.
Once I got back home it was right back to work though.
What I was working on was modifying this program that parses a file I downloaded a few days ago.
That file was one one of the several that I downloaded from my instagram account.
And the one I was working with today was a list of all the instagram conversations I’ve ever had.
Anyways I got into the flow of working on that and by the time I was done it was super late.
I am really happy with how it turned out though so it’s fine.
I just hope this wont mess up my sleeping schedule too much.
