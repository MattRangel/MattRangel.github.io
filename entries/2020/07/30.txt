July 30, 2020 - Thursday
This morning I practiced my reading in Spanish and then hung out for a while before leaving to go to my grandparents' house.
For lunch my grandmother made some tacos.
After lunch I started watching a new TV show called "Wonderfalls" (2004).
Besided watching that I also scrolled through my phone and chatted with friends.
I didn't watch a movie with my grandparents today because I could not think of any good movie.
Towards the end of the afternoon I got on my computer and messed around with some things with my Minecraft server.
That led up to dinner time and then I headed home after eating.
Once I got back home I got my teeth brushed and ready for bed.
Then I got distracted tweaking stuff on my server some more.
I finished what I was trying to do and then I called with my friend Sherry for the rest of the night.
We played some games on the computer and then I went to bed.
