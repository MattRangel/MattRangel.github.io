After waking up this morning I got on my computer and played some minecraft.
I got hungry after a bit so I took a pause to eat my breakfast of oatmeal.
Following breakfast it was time for me to go to my friend Ben’s house.
I went there earlier than I normally do, because Darious had something to do in the afternoon.
This also meant that I got home much earlier than I normall do.
Once I did get home I watched the movie “Se7en” woth my mom.
After the movie I called my friend sherry and we played minecraft together for pretty much the rest of the night.
I was really fun getting to play and talk, but I am also super tired.
I think next time I know I’m going to be staying up late I’m going to not try and write the entry right before I’m trying to go to bed
