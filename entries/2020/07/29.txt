Today was my dad’s birthday.
In the morning before leaving to go eat lunch at my grandparents’ house I got my nail cut and just hung out.
Once I did get there we all too some photos, ate luch and then dessert.
After all the eating we stayed and hung out for a while more before heading back home.
At home I hung out in my room some more before doing the dishes.
As I was finishing the dishes my dad and brother finished baking some pretzles.
So I ate some of those.
By the time I finished eating mine I found a movie called “Jojo Rabbit” (2019) to watch with my mom and dad.
After then movie I got my teeth brushed anf finished some of the new dishes.
I stayed up for a while more before finally getting the energy to write this and then go to bed
