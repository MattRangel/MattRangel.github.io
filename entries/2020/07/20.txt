July 20, 2020 - Monday
Once I got up this morning I started working on my computer with my minecraft server again.
Later on before I left to go to my grandparents’ house I had another spanish lesson with my dad.
After eating at my grandparents’ house I went back to working on my computer for a while.
I took a pause to watch the movie “Mrs. Doubtfire” (1993) with my grabdparents.
Then I went back to my computer for a bit before taking a shower and eating dinner.
Atter dinner I stayed and finished something on my computer before heading back home.
Right when I got home I got ready for bed and washed the dishes.
Following that I went back to working on my computer.
I dodn’t stay up as late as I did the past few days, but still kind of late.
