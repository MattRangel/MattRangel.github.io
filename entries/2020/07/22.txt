This morning after waking up I hopped on my computer and worked on building stuff on my minecraft server.
Some friends joined and so I played with them all for a while until my dad called me and asked me to make some rice for lunch.
Once I finished making the rice I went back to my room to play somemore until my dad got back home and made lunch.
For lunch my dad made chili and I had some of the rice I made.
After eating I headed over to my friend Darious’ house.
It was his birthday today and I gave him a pokerchip set as a present.
At his house we played pool, videos games, and also ate.
His dad made some burgers and his mom made macaroni and cheese, corn, and beans.
Once I got back home I brushed my teeth.
I was going to wash the dishes and go to my room after that, but I went on a walk with my mom afterwards instead.
On our walk I found a movie to watch with my mom called “Office Space” (1999), which we watched when we got back inside.
After the movie I washed the dishes.
Then I got on my computer and called with my friend Sherry while we played Minecraft.
I ended up staying up super late talking, but I think I’ll be fine in the morning.
Might need to take a nap later in the day though haha!
