After waking up this morning I got on my computer to play some more minecraft.
Several of my friends ended up getting on the game too, I played with them all for a while.
ThennI headed over to my grandparents’ house for the day.
For lunch my grandma made chicken wings.
Following lunch I went and played a bit more on my computer with friends.
Then I just hung out for a while.
I didn’t end up putting on a movie for my grandparents, because I could not think of a good one.
Once I got home I brushed my teeth, and then phone called with my friend Sherry.
We played some minecraft again, but not as late as we have before which is good, because I’ve been getting more tired lol.
