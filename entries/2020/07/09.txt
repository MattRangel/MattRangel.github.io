July 9, 2020 - Thursday
At my grabdparents’ house this afternoon after eating lunxh I watched YouTube and hung out on my computer.
Later on I put on the movie “Back to the Future Part III” (1990).
I ate some snacks during the movie.
Afterwards I just went back to hanging out.
Then I took a shower and ate dinner.
After I got home my dad needed to use a magnet of mine for something.
I checked out what he was doing and then got my teeth brushed.
Then my mom came home so I said hello and helped her carry in groceries.
Following that I went back to my room and phone called with a new friend of mine and played roblox with her for a bit.
After she had to get off I hung out for a bit more before finally going to sleep.
I was pretty tired while I wrote this, so that’s why some things aren’t so detailed.
I went to sleep about two hours past the time I like to try for.
