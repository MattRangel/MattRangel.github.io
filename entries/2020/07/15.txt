This morning I ate a can of ravioli for breakfast.
After that my dad gave his first spanish lesson to my brother and I.
Following that I hung out in my room for a while.
I came out to help my dad with lunch.
Then my friend Ben got to my house and we played sone board games.
Right when lunch was finished being cooked my other friend Darious got to my house.
Following lunch we went back to my room and played some more board games.
Once we were done we went outside and ate popsicles.
Then we all headed over to Ben’s house to swim.
Before we went swimming we went to Whataburger where I got a dr pepper icecream shake.
After swimming we played some more of Ben’s board game.
Then I went to drop Darious back off at his house.
On our way there we stopped at sonic and I got a cake batter shake.
I got another shake for my brother on my drive back after dropping of Darious.
Once I got home I got started on the dishes.
There was a bunch and it took me quite a while.
Then I brushed my teeth, but I got sidetracked by my phone which made that take longer than it should’ve.
I then finally went to bed three hours past the time I shoot for.
