July 18, 2020 - Saturday
I spent this morning working on and looking at server stuff for the minecraft server I bought yesterday.
My dad called me and told me that he wanted me to mow today.
So I told him that I’d do it in the afternoon.
I went back to what I was doing until it got closer to the time I said I was going to mow.
I spent the last little bit eating a lunch of rice with chicken and vegetables from yesterday.
While I was eating my mom said I got a letter back from the city I got a traffic ticket in.
I went back to my room after eating for a little while.
Then I went outside and got started on the mowing a little later than 2pm.
During while I was mowing the front wheel fell off due to a bolt breaking.
So I called my das abd he looked at it.
We ended up going out to the store to get a replacement bolt.
Once we got the wheel back on the key wouldn’t go back in to the ignition.
That ended up being another time consuming thing, but we did end up getting it to work in the end.
Those two things turned a maybe 4 hour job in to a 7 hour hour.
Once I finally was done I took a shower and then ate some more rice for dinner mixed with some beans this time.
After my dinner I called with my friend Sherry and played some Minecraft with her for the rest of the night.
I ended up going to bed super late, but hopefully as long as I go to bed on time tomorrow I’ll be fine.
