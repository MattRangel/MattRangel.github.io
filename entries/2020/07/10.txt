July 10, 2020 - Friday
After waking up this morning my mom texted me asking me to sweep the floors.
After sweeping I just hung out on my phone for a while.
My friends Ben and Darious were coming over around noon, so my dad went to go get a pizza for lunch.
While he was out getting the pizza I watched some rice for him that he punt on the stove.
After I was done watching the rice I walked around my house waiting for my friends to get there.
They ended up getting there at the same time my dad got back, so first thing we did was eat pizza.
We were going to go outside but it was way too hot so we spent most the time inside.
We ended up playing monopoly for the majority of the time.
My dad also cut up a watermelon which was good.
We had to quit monopoly after Ben had to go back home.
Darious statyed over for a while longer.
We went outside and shot at a bottle with my pellet gun and a slingshot.
After that we came back inside abd played on the Nintendo 64 until it was time for Darious to leave.
I drove him back home.
Once I got back to my house I got my teeth brushed.
I stayed up for a while more, and then went to bed about an hour and a half past the time I prefer.
Even though it wasnâ€™t even that late I was very tired.
