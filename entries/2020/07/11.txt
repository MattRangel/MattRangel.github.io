July 11, 2020 - Saturday
I woke up at my normal time today, but I was very tired.
I still got out of bed and got my teeth brushed though.
Since I was so tired I texted my friends Ben and Darious that I wouldn’t be able to hang out today.
They ended up changing the date for tomorrow, so I’ll probably go then.
After that I just hung out in my room for the morning.
At around noon my dad asked me to make the rice for lunch.
He cooked some pork and french fries.
Following lunch I went back to hanging out in my room.
I did come out a few times to eat ceareal and some other small things.
Later in the afternoon I went outside to cut my nails.
After finishing I stayed outside for a while more and went around looking at bugs and stuff.
I came back inside and a little bit later I watched a movie with my mom.
She made a batch of popcorn and then I made a half batch after we finished it.
The movie was “Devil’s Advocate” (1997).
Once the movie was over I started getting ready for bed.
I ended going to sleep around two hours before my preferred time.
