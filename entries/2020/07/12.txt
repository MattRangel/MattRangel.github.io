July 12, 2020 - Sunday
Instead of hopping on my phone after waking up and getting my teeth brushed this morning I read for a while.
I want to start reading more and it went well this morning.
After I was done I just hung out until lunch time.
For lunch my dad cooked soup and hen.
Following lunch I headed over to my friend Ben’s house to hang out with him and another friend Darious.
Before leaving my mom told me she was thinking we could’ve gone to a friend of hers daughter’s graduation party.
I told her I could fit in both and that I didn’t mind doing the driving.
At Ben’s house we all went swimming and then just hung out.
After a but my mom texted me and I went and met her in a walmart parking lot.
I then drove to her friend’s house.
On the drive there I stopped to buy some chapstick at a gas station, because my lips were dry and I forgot mine at home.
I definitely￼ over paid for it.
They had lots of food at the party.
I didn’t really talk to much and just watched stuff happen.
Once my mom and I were both ready to go we headed home.
On the drive home we listened to a podcast that I thought my mom might like, which she did.
We finally got back to the walmart amd then each drove home.
After I got home I washed the dishes which took a really long time.
Then I brushed my teeth and got ready for bed.
For the rest of my night I called with my friend Sherry and played some Minecraft with her.
I ended up going to bed kind of late.
Hopefully I’ll be able to fully get back on track with that this week.
