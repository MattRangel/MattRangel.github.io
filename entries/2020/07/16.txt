Today was very uneventful, so this entry will be pretty brief.
Woke up- scrolled through my phone and watched YouTube.￼
Then went to my grandparents’ where I did some more of that along with eating.
I also watched the movie “Cool Runnings” (1993).
Once I got home I procrastinated getting ready for bed.
After I did I stayed up a while more going to bed around an hour late.
