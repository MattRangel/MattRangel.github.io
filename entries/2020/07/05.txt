July 5, 2020 - Sunday
I was really tired this morning so I slept in a little later than I normally do.
Once I was up I ate a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast and watched some YouTube.
After I finised breakfast I hopped on my computer.
I was just browsing around at first and then I started writing up more computer stuff.
Todayâ€™s project was just working with CSS.
I never really did too much with it before today, but I actually got the hang of it pretty easily.
I ended up spending the rest of the day working away on my computer.
I took a break make rice for lunch and then another to eat the lunch of chicken, cucumber salad, and rice.
My next two breaks were eating breaks too.
One to eat watermelon and then another to eat dinner.
For dinner I just had the chicken and rice from lunch.
After that I had another pause to go on a walk with my mom.
Once I got back inside it was back to work until I was finally happy with what I made.
So I then got ready for bed and cleaned my room.
Today was definitely not a successful go to bed on time day.
