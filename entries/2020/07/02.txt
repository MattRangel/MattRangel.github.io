July 2, 2020 - Thursday
This morning before leaving for my grandparents’ house I just hung out in my room.
Over at my grandparents’ house after eating I texted with friends and also played a bit of minecraft with my friend Joaquin and then Jay later on.
I put on the movie “Short Circuit” (1986) later in afternoon to watch with my grandparents.
After the movie I called with my friend Gena and watched the movie “Slacker” (1990) with her.
We both had to get off and pause it during the middle.
I had to take a shower and eat dinner.
Once I got back home I got ready for bed and brushed my teeth.
Then I called with Gena again and finished the movie.
I had already seen the movie before, but I didn’t mind seeing it again.
After the movie I just hung out on my phone.
I ended up doing that for longer than what I would’ve liked and went to bed about 40 minutes late.
