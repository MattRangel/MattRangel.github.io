July 26, 2020 - Sunday
I spent my first little bit of this morning practicing my spanish reading.
Once I was done with that I ate some leftovers from yesterday for breakfast.
After breakfast I played some minecraft on my computer until my dad asked me to help him with lunch.
We were going to have panda express for lunch but the line was too long so my dad decided to make his own panda express.
A little while after I had finished lunch my dad went to my grandparents’ house to give them some of the food.
Once we got back I got the dishes done then sat back down at my computer.
This time it was for something more  productive though haha.
I purchased the defensive driving class I needed and glt started om the lessons.
After I got a ways into it I took a break.
I called with my friend Sherry and we watched a tv show episode together.
Following that we both got on minecraft and played for the rest of the night.
I went to bed very late, but I’m thinking it’ll still all be fine.
Just have to make sure not to keep staying up so often lol.
