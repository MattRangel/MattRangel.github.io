This morning I ate some beans and rice from yesterday for breakfast.
Then I did another morning spanish lesson with my dad.
After that I went and hung out in my room for a while.
I went with my mom while she went to get her car tires rotated and oil changed.
At the end of all the errands we went to sonic and I got a lemonade strawberry ice cream slush.
Once we got home my dad was finishing up lunch.
He made pretzels with my brother, some rice with chicken and vegetables, and french fries.
I then went back to my room for pretty much the rest of the afternoon plus night.
At some point I looked into buying a minecraft server, because the free trial I have is about to run out and it was fun having it.
I did end up finding one for a good price after searching around for a good while.
Then I looked into hooking up a mattrangel.net domian to it.
Figuring out how exactly that works was time consuming.
I am actually going to probably transfer my domain to a different registrar, because it’ll be cheaper to renew each year.
I got pretty lost in to what I was doing which led to me going to bed almost 4 hours late.
I’m pretty sure I got all the things I was working at done though which is nice.
