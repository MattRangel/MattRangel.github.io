July 28, 2020 - Tuesday
I woke up at a more normal time this morning compared to yesterday.
So I had time to practice my spanish reading and also hang out for a bit before leaving to go to my grandparents’ house.
After eating the lunch my grandma made I looked for a movie to watch with my grandparents.
I ended up finding the movie “Kindergarten Cop” (1990), which they enjoyed.
Following that movie I watched another movie on my phone with a couple friends (Gena and Jay).
It was a long movie so I had to pause to go eat dinner and then finish it once I got back home.
After that movie I washed the dishes and got my teeth brushed.
I then spent the last little bit of my night talking on the phone and playing Minecraft with my friend Sherry.
I went to bed at an alright time, especially compared to Sunday night.
