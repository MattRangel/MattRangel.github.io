July 21, 2020 - Tuesday
I spent this morning working and also playing on my computer.
I accidentally left my house late because I was deep into the zone of what I was doing.
Once I did get my grandparents’ house I ate the gumbo my grandma made and then went back to playing on my computer.
Later on I watched the movie “Ghostbusters” (1984) with my grandparents.
Afterwards I made some cheese with my grandma.
While we were waiting for the milk to heat up I took my shower.
After we were done with the cheese I played some more Minecraft.
Then ate some more gumbo for dinner and headed home.
Once I got home I did the dishes then got all ready for bed.
I spent the rest of my night building things on my Minecraft server, because I was finally done tweaking it.
I ended up staying awake a little too late, but I’m happy with the progress I made on my building at least.
