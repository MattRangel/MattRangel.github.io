July 25, 2020 - Saturday
Today was just playing minecraft.
I helped my dad make lunch and we had carrots, porkchops, and squash.
Later in the afternoon I called my friend Sherry and we talked and played minecraft for the rest of the afternoon/night.
Before I was about to go to bed there was some upset that happened earlier, so everyone had something to say for a while.
Once that was done I went to bed.
I ended up going to bed at a pretty good time tonight.
