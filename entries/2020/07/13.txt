July 13, 2020 - Monday
I read again this morning, but not for too long because I wasn’t really feeling like it.
I also called the court people that gave me a speeding ticket to see if they received my letter that I sent about two weeks ago.
They said they did receive it and already had a letter for me coming in the mail which was good to hear.
Later on around noon when I was about five minutes away from getting to my grandparents’ house I remembered that I forgot to grab some food that was for them from my house.
So I had to drive all the way back home to go and get it.
I hung out on my phone for a bit after eating lunch.
Then I put on the movie “￼Jurassic Park” (1993).
After the movie I took a quick nap.
It was already almost time to eat dinner by that time so I took my shower and then ate.
Once I got home I put a YouTube video on my phone and got the dishes done.
Then I got my teeth brushes.
There was still a while left before I had to go to bed so I watched some more YouTube.
I ended calling with my friend Sherry and watching the first episode of a TV show with her.
After that episode was over we got off the phone and I went to bed.
I did good by going to bed less than an hour passed the time I wanted.
