July 1, 2020 - Wednesday
For breakfast I ate a can of SpaghettiOs.
After that I went back to hanging out in my room.
My friend Ben texted me if I wanted to hang out again today.
I asked my parents anf they were fine with it.
So when it came time to go I got in my car and drove to my friend Darious’ house to pick him up.
Once we got to Ben’s house we went swimming for a while.
Then we went and ate a Taco Bell.
Ben wasn’t really satisfied with the Taco Bell so they went to Popeye’s Chicken to get some sandwiches.
Following Popeye’s we went to Whataburger to get some shakes.
After all that eating I was really full and we all headed over to Darious’ house.
At his house we played some pool.
Then we started the movie “Unforgiven” (1992), but stopped it half way through because we were all tired and kind of ready to go home.
For my whole car ride home I listened to this song I found earlier this morning called “Alberto Balsalm” by Aphex Twin.
Once I got home I did the dishes and got ready for bed.
Then I spent the last little bit of my night playing a basketball game on Roblox with Ben and Darious.
