July 31, 2020 - Friday
I woke up this morning to my dad asking me if I wanted to ride with to the store.
I said yes and then got ready for the day.
He went to a tool shop and also walmart.
Once we got back home I went and hung out in my room.
He said he was going to make pizza, so I waited to eat unil that was ready.
It turned out that we didn’t have sauce for him to make pizza, so we had some eggs and tortillas.
I spent the next while in my room just hanging out.
I helped my dad make some crab rangoons.
Then my mom got back home with sauce from the store to make the pizza.
I went on a walk with my mom and shortly after we were done with that the dinner was almost ready.
My pizza had pineapple, sausage, and onions.
After dinner I watched the movie “Imperium” (2016) with my mom and dad.
Following that movie I watched a TV show episode on my phone with my friend Sherry.
I took a pause in the middle to eat the strawberry ice cream shake my dad and brother made.
After we finished watching TV I got my teeth brushed.
And then I ended my night off calling Sherry again and playing some minecraft.
