July 4, 2020 - Saturday
I spent all of this morning just hanging out in my room doing nothing for great importance.
Some time in the afternoon my dad made lunch which was steak, risotto, and squash.
It was all very good.
I went back to my room for a while.
Then my dad called for me.
He wanted to try out the kite he made outside.
My mom and brother came outside too and with some modifications we got it to stay up in the air for a little bit.
I don’t think it was windy enough for it to work as good as it could’ve though.
After we were done with the homemade kite my dad flew a different one that he’s had for a long time.
I even got to fly the kite for a while.
After kite flying I came back inside and ate a bowl of cereal and then a bowl of risotto for dinner.
Following my dinner I went back to hanging out in my room.
Around and hour before I like to go to sleep I got ready for bed.
I spent the last little bit of my night just listening to music.
