July 7, 2020 - Tuesday
I woke up very tired this morning which does not suprsie me at all.
I still got out of bed when I woke up instead of going back to bed though because it was already an hour past my normal waking up time.
Today's activties were pretty similar to yesterday's.
Starting my morning off hanging out on my computer and phone.
When I started to get ready to go to my grandparents' house I looked outside and it was very dark and gloomy.
By the time I got into the car it was starting to to rain, and once I was on my drive it began full on down pouring.
Got to my grandparents' house fine though and ate some vegetables, chicken, and mashed potatoes.
After eating I went back to hanging out on my computer and phone.
Later in the day I put on the movie "Back to the Future Part II" (1989) to watch with my grandparents.
During the movie I ate a popsicle, a bowl of ice cream, and an orange.
Following the movie I went back to hanging out and then took a shower.
For dinner my grandma made ravioli and bread.
Once I got back home I got half ready for bed and then went on a walk with my mom.
Getting back inside I did the dishes and then finsihed getting ready for bed.
I then hopped on my computer and just hung out in my room for the rest of my night.
I went to bed at an earlier time than I did yesterday, so I am slowly getting better and better.
Hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to go to bed on time easily since I won't be coming home from anywhere.
