July 19, 2020 - Sunday
I woke up at my normal time using my alarm clock, because I didnâ€™t want to sleep in too late.
I spent all this morning and a little bit into this afternoon working on my computer.
I was working on was server things for my Minecraft server.
For lunch my dad made some chili and also reheated some of rice with chicke.
Following lunch I went back to working on my computer.
After a little bit my dad invited me to go to Dairy Queen and get some icecream.
My brother and I each got chocolate dipped cones like we normally do, but this time they also gave us some free fries which was cool.
Getting back from ice cream my dad and I (and also my brother for a little bit) went outside and organized the shed.
That ended up taking way longer than I thought it was going to.
Once I finally did get back inside I took a shower, ate dinner, washed the dishes, and brushed my teeth.
By the time I finished doing all of those things it was kind of late.
I still decided to call my friend Sherry though and we played Minecraft for the rest of the night.
