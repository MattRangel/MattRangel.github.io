July 27, 2020 - Monday
I woke up pretty late this morning so I didn’t really hang out at home any.
After eating at my grandparents’ house I got on my computer and played some Minecraft for a bit.
I eventually found a movie to watch with my grandparents called “Airplane” 1980.
I ate some snaks during the movie and then after I took a shower and ate dinner.
Once I got back home I had to do the dishes, but I procrastinated for a while.
I also procrastinated going to bed and ended up going to bed a little late ahain tonight.
