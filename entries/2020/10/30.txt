October 30, 2020 - Friday
I thought I was going to have some difficult work to do at school today, but once I actually put myself to do the work wasn’t really too hard.
After my school day I layed down and watched some YouTube.
Laying there I got tired and ended up falling asleep.
I woke up to give my mom my brothers’ lunch which my grandma made.
After I left my grandparents’ house I went to Walmart.
First I filled up my gas and then I went inside Walmart to get some taller socks than what I already have.
Following that I headed home to watch a movie with my mom.
She had already found a movie to watch yesterday called “The Hustle” (2019).
Following that I went and hung out in my room for a bit until I got the energy to brush my teeth.
Next I was going to play Minecraft with my brother, but it had gotten too late and he already fell asleep.
So I went back to my room and stayed up awhile more before going to bed.
