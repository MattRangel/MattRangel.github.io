October 17, 2020 - Saturday
I woke up at a regular time this morning even though I went to bed pretty late.
I spent the morning hanging out with my brother watching YouTube and going on the golf cart.
Once it go to be noon I started getting ready to go hang out with my friends Ben and Darious.
Before going to Ben’s house I went to pick up Darious.
At Ben’s house we went swimming and played video games.
For dinner Ben’s dad made Mongolian food.
After that we got in the pool then the hot tub for a while.
On our was to go hang out at Darious’ house we stopped at sonic.
We all got the holloween candy shake.
Then we went to Darious’ house where we ended up leaving pretty soon after we got there.
Once I was back in my own car I headed home.
When I got home my mom and I looked for a package which ended up being by our garage.
Then I got ready for bed.
Following that I set out a tarp and got my clippers to shave my mowhawk off.
Then I took and shower and went back to my room.
Next I played Minecraft on my computer with my friend Kai.
After I got up I stated awake a while longer procrastinating writing this entry up.
