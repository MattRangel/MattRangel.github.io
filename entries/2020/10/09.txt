October 9, 2020 - Friday
My school day today once again went by pretty quickly since I already had most of my school work dond.
After that I hung out and watched YouTube.
Towards then end of the day I also worked on my Minecraft server a little bit.
I also paid for the next few months of it.
Once I got home after eating dinner I watched the movie “Along Came a Spider” (2001) with my mom.
After the movie I got ready for bed and then went to my room.
I sat down and played Minecraft with my friends Kai and Sherry for a while.
After we all got off I stayed up a while more just scrolling through my phone and messaging a little bit with people.
