The only reason my school day today took a while was because I spent a while working ahead.
Following my school day I watched some YouTube until it was time for me to go get my photo taken at school.
After I got there I realized I was an hour early, so I got gas then went back to my grandparents’ house until it was actually time to get my photo taken.
Once I got to school I found my friend Yamiel and we went inside the school to the library.
After we got our photos taken we parted ways and I went back to my grandparents’ house.
I watched some more YouTube then I took a nap until it was time to eat dinner.
Once I got back home I went on a walk with my mom.
Then I washed the dishes and got ready for bed.
Thoes two things took way longer than they should’ve though, because I kept getting off task.
I helped my mom with her computer some and made her popcorn before going to my room for the night.
Once I got in bed I stayed up a bit more procrastinating writing this.
