October 2, 2020 - Friday
I brought a CD player to my grandparents’ house this morning for them to use, because the one they had before would skip sometimes for no reason.
My school day today was just two tasks.
First I read my book for free reading time in english class.
Next I did a worksheet for history.
After I finished thoes I was pretty much done for the day.
I ate lunch then layed down and tried to rest for a little bit.
Then it got to be time for me to go to my haircut appointment that my dad set up.
I did’t really care too much, but he really wanted me to so I did.
After my haircut I stayed with my mom and watched my brother get his haircut.
Once I got back to my grandparents’ house I started downloading a album that had songs in spanish from different artists all about doves.
My favorite song off the album was “Palomita Errante - Fausto Huayamabe”.
I gave the CD to my grandma and she played it on the player while I ate dinner.
After dinner I sat with my grandparents a little while longer before packing up my things and heading home.
Before I went home I stopped at walmart to get gas and also some raisins.
Once I got home I watched the movie “Colors” (1988).
After the movie I brushed my teeth.
Following that I chatted with my mom for a while and then went on a walk with her.
My dad joined us on the walk too, but my brother did not because he had homework.
Once I cane back inside I chatted with my mom some more.
Then I went to my room amd stayed up a little bit more.
