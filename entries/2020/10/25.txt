October 25, 2020 - Sunday
I didn’t eat breakfast this morning, because by the time I woke up my dad was already cooking lunch.
I spent the morning working on homebrewing my 3DS which involved following along with a YouTube video that showed how to do the exploit.
By the time my dad finished cooking I was still working, so I just took a pause.
For lunch my dad made pork, rice, and cabbage.
After lunch I went back to working on my 3DS.
After I finished the more difficult part (which wasn’t even that hard) I went to the store to buy a bigger micro SD card.
My mom cane along with me too.
The SD card I had was only 4GB and the one I bought is 128GB.
After that my mom and I went to goodwill so I could look for some jeans.
Goodwill was overwhelming for me though, so we left.
Next we stopped at the car wash and then headed home.
We ended up turning around though to go look for jeans at Target.
Over there we found two pairs that I might like.
We also walked passed the snack isle and I got some beef jerky and my mom got some chocolate.
Once we got back home I installed the new SD card into my 3DS and got the files transferd over.
Then I tried on the pants we bought and decided that I liked one of the pairs that we got and the others will just be returned.
Then I watched the movie “Unhinged” (2020) with my mom and dad.
My movie night snacks were blueberries and marshmallows.
After the movie I got my teeth brushed.
Following that I cleaned up my room then layed in bed.
I stayed up for a really long time procrastinating having to write this entry.
I am definitely going to have to start doing it as part of my getting ready for bed routine.
Because me staying up late not feeling like writing the entry for the day is undoubtedly a trend.
