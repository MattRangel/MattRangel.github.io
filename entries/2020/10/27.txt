October 27, 2020 - Tuesday
Even though I didn’t get too much sleep I wasn’t too exhausted today.
After dropping my brother off at his school I went to my grandparents’ house and got started on my school day.
I did good at not getting distracted and finished my school day with ease.
For lunch my grandma made rive and gumbo.
My day following school was pretty much just watching YouTube.
Today’s interests were computers and video games.
As a snack I had some pineapple, then some rice pudding left over from my birthday, and finally some popcorn.
My dinner was the same as my lunch.
After dinner I hung out a bit more before leaving to go home.
On my drive home I listened to some music cranked up with my windows down.
I’m not sick of the cold yet so it’s still pretty refreshing to feel.
Once I got home I said hello to my parents then layed down in my bed.
Luckily I got a burst of energy to get up and get ready for bed before it got too late.
I put on some music then washed the dishes and got my teeth brushed.
Then I put a new battery in my gate opener and set out a special sponge
to take to my grandparents’ house tomorrow.
After that I washed my face and got into bedtime clothes.
I went to bed at a much better time than yesterday.
Hopefully I’ll be able to get back into the habit of going to bed on time now.
