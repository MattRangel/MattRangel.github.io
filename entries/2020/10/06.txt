October 6, 2020 - Tuesday
My school day today was pretty normal.
After finishing I finished watching the movie “Vivarium” (2019).
Following that movie I watched another called “Dawn of the Dead” (2004).
Then I watched some YouTube and ate dinner.
As I got back home my mom and brother were about to go on a walk.
So I hurried inside to put my things anway then came back outside to walk with them.
Along the walk we played frisbee.
Once we got back inside my mom and I watched a movie named “Alone in Berlin” (2016).
We were going to watch a different movie, but it was kind of long.
During the movie I ate some of my golden raisins and my mom ate some of my Minecraft cereal which I let her have.
Following the movie I watched some YouTube videos.
I was in my room at first, but I didn’t want to waste too much time so I got up and washed the dishes then got ready for bed.
Then before going to bed I stayed up a little while later watching some more YouTube.
