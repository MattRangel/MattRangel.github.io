October 19, 2020 - Monday
I was pretty tired after waking up this morning which didn’t suprise me.
My school day wasn’t too long today.
Once I was finished I listened to music and worked on a playlist.
Then I ate my lunch.
Afyer lunch I read a book for a little bit then went back to listening to music.
Following that I watched the movie “American Psycho” (2000).
Then I watched YouTube and chatted with friends for a while.
Later on I made cinnamon rolls with my grandma which I ate with my dinner.
After dinner I headed back home.
The hard drive that I ordered in the mail to try to fix my brother’s laptop came in the mail.
So after I got the new hard drive put into the computer I waited for my mom to be done using her computer so I could take out the usb that I needed.
After messing up a little on the first time laptop now had an operating system installed on it’s new hard drive.
Following that I washed the dishes then got all ready for bed.
The time thoes few thing took was way long that it seems written out, because I kept stopping and doing stuff on my phone.
Once I was finally finished I stayed up a little while more procrastinating writing this.
I think I need to go back to not waiting until the last moment to write it.
