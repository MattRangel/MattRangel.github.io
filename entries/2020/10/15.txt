October 15, 2020 - Thursday
I woke up pretty tired this morning, but by the time I got to my grandparents’ house I was awake.
My school day today was much shorter than I was planning for, because a project I was going to have to do got moved to next week.
Following my school day I pretty much just did the same thing as yesterday.
I watched some YouTube, took a nap, then watched some more YouTube.
I also go into a new groupchat with two of my friends and then a group of new people.
Today my dad left to go do work, but before he left he stopped by and said goodbye to my grandparents and I.
Once I got back home I watched a movie with my mom called “The Devil All the Time” (2020).
Following that I got ready for bed.
My get ready for bed process was super dragged out tonight though, because I was getting sidetracked after pretty much each step.
Once I finnaly finished that I stayed up a while longer to write this entry.
I ended up not starting for a while though which put me going to bed even later.
Before finally writting this up and going to sleep I helped my mom with her computer some.
