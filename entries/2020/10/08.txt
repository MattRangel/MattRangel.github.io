October 8, 2020 - Thursday
This morning after waking up I got a bloody nose from rubbing / scratching it too much.
Luckily it stopped pretty shortly after it started.
Leaving my house I passed my mom a little before I was going to turn onto the highway.
She got out of the car to give me a hug and said good morning which was cool.
I didn’t have too much school work to do today, because I had already finished most of it earlier in the week.
After school I watched some YouTube for a while.
Then I watched the movie “Fargo” (1996).
Following that I took a nap for a while.
Once I was awake again I watched some more YouTube and then ate dinner.
For dinner I had shrimp alfreado pasta.
After I got back home I went on a walk with my mom.
On our way back from the walk my dad, who was working outside, called for me.
He needed me to help push the ATV off the trailer and into a new spot.
I then went back inside to watch a movie with my mom.
It took us quite a while to find one, but we did eventually.
We then stopped it in the middle of it, because my mom didn’t really like it.
So we looked for a new movie, but we couldn’t really find one and ended up going back to the one we stopped.
During the movie I finished the banana ice cream my mom got for me the other day and also the box rasins I bought last weekend.
Following the movie I got ready for bed then I cleaned up my room some.
Before finally going to bed I stayed up a little while longer on my phone.
