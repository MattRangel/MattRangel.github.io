October 8, 2020 - Wednesday
My school day was pretty easy today, but I still got a lot of work done.
Afterwards I watched some YouTube for pretty much the rest of the afternoon.
I also scheduled the day I’m going to get my school pictures taken.
My friend Yamiel was also able to sign up for the same time as me.
In the night once I got home I went on a walk with my mom.
Then we watched the movie “Free State of Jones” (2016).
During the movie I ate a little bit of the banana ice cream that my mom and brother got for me earlier while I was at my grandparents’ house.
Following the movie I got ready for bed and then did the dishes before going to bed.
