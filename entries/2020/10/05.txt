October 5, 2020 - Monday
This morning was my brother’s first day going back to at school learning.
So it was just me at my grandparents’ house today and it will probably be like that for a while.
My school day was a bit long today, but that was partly because I was working ahead.
The other part being that my english class had a lot work that just took a long time.
Once I was done with my school day I just layed down for a while then watched YouTube on my phone until it was dinner time.
After dinner I headed back home like usual.
Then I hung out for a bit procrastinating doing the dishes and getting ready for bed.
My mom called for me to get a credit card for my wallet.
Once I was up I did my nightly chores and then went back to hanging out.
While I did the dishes I continued watching the movie “Vivarium” (2019) which I started yesterday.
I didn’t finish it tonight either, but I probably will tomorrow once I’m done with my work.
