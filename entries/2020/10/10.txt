October 10, 2020 - Saturday
I woke up early this morning, but I went back to sleep again aftering going to the bathroom.
My for real wake up was when my dad came into my room and said we’re all going out to eat.
Before going to eat my parents stopped at a couple places to run errands.
We were going to go to this waffle place, but when we got there the wait time to get a table was way too long.
So we left and ended up choosing to go eat at BJ’s instead.
I got chicken alfredo pasta.
Once we got back home my brother and I helped my dad clean up tools outside in the shed.
Then we moved the ATV into the new cleaned area of the shed.
Following that I helped him while he rewired a trailer.
We didn’t finish all the way though, because it was time for him to leave to a wedding.
I closed up the shed and then came inside and hung out.
I played Minecraft with my friend Kai for a little while.
Then I took a shower and played a game on the phone with my brother.
Following that we ordered sonic on my phone then went to go pick it up.
We were going to get Chipotle, but it was a bit too expensive.
I accidentally went to the wrong Sonic, so it was a little longer of a trip than I planned.
After we got our food at the correct Sonic we stopped at my grandparents’ house on the way o
home.
Once I got home I watcged some YouTube videos with my brother and ate my hamburger.
We watched YouTube until my parents got home and then I went back to my room.
I got on Minecraft again and I played with my friends Kai and Sherry.
Instead of talking on the phone this time we all just listened to music together.
We got off the game pretty late and then I stayed up even later scrolling through my phone while I procrastinated writing this up.
