October 4, 2020 - Sunday
For breakfast I had my left over pizza that my dad made yesterday.
Then that I watched the movie “Dawn of the Dead” (1978).
After that I started watching the movie “Vivarium” (2019), but I stopped when my dad called for me.
He asked if I wanted to come with him while he went to buy an ATV.
That ended up taking up quite a while.
On our way back we stopped for sandwiches.
Once we got back home I ate my sandwich the hung out for a bit.
After a while my dad asked me to help him outside some.
That took up the rest of the afternoon.
Once I came back inside I hung out until I got up to do the dishes and get ready for bed.
I was going to play on my computer for a little bit, but I ended up not.
