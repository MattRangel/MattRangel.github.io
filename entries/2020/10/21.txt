October 21, 2020 - Wednesday
My school day today was a pretty regular short one.
Afterwards I scrolled through stuff on my phone and texted with friends.
Once I got tired of that I spent a while looking for a good movie to watch.
I do have a list of movies on my watchlist, but I wasn’t really in the mood for any of them.
Eventually I chose the movie “The Revenant” (2015).
I stayed at my grandparents’ house a little while more after eating dinner to finish the movie.
Once I got back home I helped my mom figure out how to take apart the pumpkin that she bought on Sunday like we planned.
We gutted out the inside of it then cut into cubes.
After that we looked up if we should cook it or not.
It turns out that all types of squash are healthier when they’re cooked.
So we boiled the cubes then mashed them into a purée.
Next we scooped portions of the pumpkin mush into plastic bags to freeze.
Once we were all finished I got my teeth brushed then took a shower.
Then I went to bed.
The pumpkin project took quite a while and I ended up going to bed late, but it was fun and I don’t really mind.
