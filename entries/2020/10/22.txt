October 22, 2020 - Thursday
After my brother and I left for school my mom later left to go to her church retreat for the weekend.
My schoolday today was a lot of work, but I still got it done kind of fast.
While I was finishing up my last little bit of work I watched a short documentary about planned obsolescence￼.
After my school day my grandma gave me some money to buy a pizza and some breadsticks for lunch.
Before I went to Little Caesars I stopped at Walmart to get some gas.
I ordered a half Hawaiian half pepperoni pizza and some regular breadsticks.
Once I got back I ate my lunch and then just hung out on my phone until it was time to pick my brother up from school.
I got to his school pretty early so while I waited for him I just listened to music and texted with friends.
After her got out of school and into the car we headed back to my grandparents’ house for dinner.
My grandma made me shrimp alfredo pasta.
Then I watched some YouTube for a bit before heading back home.
Once I got home I ate a few pieces of candy and also some of a rice krispy treat my mom made before leaving.
Then I went outside and called with a few somewhat new friends for a tiny bit.
Next I came back inside and got ready for bed.
Even though I was ready to go to bed at a good time I ended up staying awake for a while longer.
I stayed up unil it was the next day (my birthday!) and then I went to bed.
