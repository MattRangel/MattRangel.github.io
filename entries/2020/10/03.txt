October 3, 2020 - Saturday
Today was just a hanging out day.
For breakfast my dad make pancakes which I helped a little with.
After that I got on the computer and played minecraft with my friends Sherry and Kai for a while.
My parents left to take my brother to a church thing and while they were gone I prepared pizza dough for my dad.
In afternoon I watched the movie “Blue Ruin” (2013) with my mom.
While we watched the movie my dad made pizzas using the dough I made earlier.
After that movie I went to my room and hung out for a bit.
I ended up starting the movie “Soylent Green” (1973).
I stopped half way through the movie to take my mom to walmart.
Once I got back I ate some cookies my dad and brother made.
Then I got ready for bed and then went back to my room.
I started the movie again and then finished it after a while.
