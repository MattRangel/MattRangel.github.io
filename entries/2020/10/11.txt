October 11, 2020 - Sunday
I slept in this morning, because I stayed up late last night.
Once I was awake I hung out on my phone for a bit until my dad called me to give me the lunch he made.
After that I went back to hanging out.
I ended up comming across the fact that even though I live in America I can subscribe to the Indian price of YouTube premium.
So I did that which was really cool, because normally it’s like $11.99 a month, but now it’s only going to be around $2 a month.
After that I worked on getting mods to work on my Minecraft server for my friend Sherry and I to play.
I stopped once it was time to take my brother to his church class.
As I was leaving the church I saw my dad leaving his friend’s house, so we pulled into an HEB parking lot.
We went inside and got some ice cream bars.
Then we got back into our cars and went back home.
At home I watched the movie “Acts of Violence” (2018) with my dad and ate some grapes.
After the movie I brushed my teeth then washed the dishes.
Next I cleaned my face then cleaned up my room.
Following that I stayed up late playing my modded Minecraft server with Sherry.
I went to bed a little late for a school night, but definitely not as late as I was going to sleep this weekend.
