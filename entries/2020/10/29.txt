Today’s is going to be short, because I’m tired while I’m writing it right now.
My school day was short today.
I fell asleep afterwards.
Then I tried photo editing some watermarks off of a school photo until it was time for dinner.
On my way home I stopped at Dollar General to get my family some ice cream.
I didn’t want any.
When I was taking my phone off of it’s dock thing to go inside the store the dock broke.
Once I got home I got ready for bed.
Once again I didn’t write my entry right after that and ended up staying awake late into the night.
