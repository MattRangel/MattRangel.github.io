October 28, 2020 - Wednesday
My school day today wasn’t too hard, but it did take kind of a long time compared to the last few days though.
The working I was having to do was fun work for my graphic design class, so I wasn’t really bothered.
After class I watched a bit of YouTube.
I also texted with my mom and we planned to go to early voting after I left my grandparents’ house.
My shower and dinner were earlier than usual, because I had to leave to get to the polling place on time.
Once I got to the polling place I found my mom and we went and got in line.
The wait wasn’t too long and since I figured out who I was going to vote ahead it didn’t take too long.
We took a photo in front of the polling place sign with out “I Voted” stickers.
Then we both headed home.
I was right behind my mom for the whole drive home.
Once we did get home I watched the movie “Molly’s Game” (2018) with her.
After that I did the dishes then got ready for bed.
I took long breaks between each of thoes things, which combined with watching the movie made me got to bed pretty late.
Tomorrow will be more normal though, so hopefully I’ll get back on track.
