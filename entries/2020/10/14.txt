October 14, 2020 - Wednesday
My school day today was somewhat long compared to other days.
After I finished I watched Minecraft gameplay on YouTube for a while then I took a nap.
I didn’t stay asleep for as long as I did yesterday, but it was still a while.
Following my nap I just watched some more YouTube and then ate dinner.
Once I got back home I looked a little more into the college that I’m thinking of attending.
I also talked about it with my mom who answered some of my questions.
Within the next few days I’m planning on applying to University of Central Florida if I can get all the things needed organized.
Once we came back inside I watched the movie “First Kill” (2017) with my mom.
Then I washed the dishes and got ready for bed.
In the middle of getting ready for bed and afterwards I got distracted which kept me up a little bit later.
