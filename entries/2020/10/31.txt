October 31, 2020 - Saturday
Shortly after waking up this morning my dad made pancakes breakfast.
Following breakfast I headed out to my friend Yamiel’s house.
I waoted for him to finish cleaning his room and then we left to go skating.
The spot he chose was one that I hadn’t been to before, but it was pretty cool.
Later on another friend named Jacob came and skateboarded with us.
Once we were all tired and hungry we went to Taco Bell for lunch.
Then we headed back to the park to eat our food.
After we finished lunch we got some snow cones for dessert.
We skateboarded and played hackysack for a little while more before leaving.
We dropped Jacob then Yamiel drove back to his house where my car was parked.
Before going anywhere I coordinated where I was going to go next.
I ended up heading over to Ben’s house to hang out just me and him, because our other friend Darious was busy.
We ended up finding a movie called “Homest Theif” to watch in the theater.
The snacks and even just a water were all pretty expensive.
After the movie we went back to Ben’s house and I tried his VR headset.
That was my first time using an actual expensive VR headest and it was pretty cool how well it worked.
We hung out in his room some and then went outside and hung out in the hot tup.
Shortly after we were back inside I headed back to my own house.
At my house I said hello to everyone then just layed down on my phone for a bit.
Once I got the energy I got ready to go to bed.
Then I stayed up a little bit more before writing this up then going to bed.
