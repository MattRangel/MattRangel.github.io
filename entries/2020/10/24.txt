October 24, 2020 - Saturday
This morning after waking up I stayed in bed a bit on my phone before getting up.
After I got up and brushed my teeth I ate some chicken wings that my grandma made for my brother the other day, but he said I could have some.
Then I went back to my room and just hung out some more on my phone for the next little bit.
Following that my dad made steak and potatoes for lunch which were very good.
Next I got on my computer and played some minecraft with my brother.
We played for a good while.
Then we both went with my dad to a fancy ice cream and flavored ice place.
I chose cotton candy, my brother chose cherry, and my dad didn’t get anything.
Before heading back home my dad stopped at Walmart to get a few things then we were on our way.
Once I got home I messaged with friends for a bit.
Then I played Minecraft with my friend Kai for a little.
Next I stayed up for a while more before finally going to bed.
I’m pretty sure I went to bed at a better time that yesterday, but I’n not for sure.
