October 20, 2020 - Tuesday
My school day today lasted pretty long.
Right when I was about to finish up for the day I got a call from my mom who said she got a flat tire on her way to pick up my brother from school.
So I had to go and pick up my brother from and take him home.
I was going to take him to my grandparents’ house, but they didn’t want that.
After dropping him off I went back to my grandparents’ house and layed down.
I didn’t take a nap though I just watched YouTube videos.
After dinner I headed back home.
Once I got home I went on a walk with my mom.
Then I got my teeth brushed and washed the dishes.
I got all that done earlier than what I normally do which was nice and helped me go to bed a little closer to on time.
After I finished getting ready I stayed up a while more on my phone until it got a bit later.
