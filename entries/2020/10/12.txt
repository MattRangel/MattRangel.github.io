October 12, 2020 - Monday
I was a bit tired waking up this morning, but I got throught my school day fine.
There wasn’t too much work today and luckily I didn’t have any projects that needed starting.
After school I watched some YouTube and texted with friends.
I was still tired though, so after a bit of that I put on some music and took a nap.
Following my nap I watched some more YouTube and ate a bowl of ice cream.
Then I got on my computer and played some more modded Minecraft with my friend Sherry until it was time to eat dinner.
After dinner I headed home, but I made a stop at Walmart first.
I needed to buy a white t-shirt in order for my school picture day tomorrow.
Once I got home I went on a walk with my mom.
Then we watched a movie with my dad called “The Hunter’s Prayer” (2017).
Next I brushed my teeth then washed the dishes.
Following that I went outside to cut my nails.
I came back inside then shaved for the first time in a while since I’m getting my photo taken tomorrow.
After I washed my face I went to my room and got distracted on my phone for a little bit before going to bed.
