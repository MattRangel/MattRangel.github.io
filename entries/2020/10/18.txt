October 18, 2020 - Sunday
I woke up on my own this morning getting a full night of rest.
After I got up I got my teeth brushed then ate some breakfast.
My breakfast today was my leftover chicken wings from Friday.
While they were heating up I ate some of the cinnamon rolls that my brother had just made.
Following breakfast I went to my room and watched YouTube and chatted with friends.
I came out at one point to eat some of the gummy bears and Hi-Chews that my friend Audrey Shae gave me on Friday.
In the afternoon I had to take my brother my brother to his church class.
After I got back home from dropping him off I got on my computer and played Minecraft with my friends Sherry and Kai.
My mom got back home while I was playing so I took a pause and went to say hello to her.
She had stopped at Walmart on her way home and bought a pumpkin like we talked about a few days ago.
We were both to tired to do it tonight though, so we are going to cut it open another day.
Once I got off of my computer I washed the dishes and then got ready for bed.
Then I got in bed, but I stayed up later editing photos to post to my instagram.
After I finally finished editing them I uploaded the photos then went to bed.
