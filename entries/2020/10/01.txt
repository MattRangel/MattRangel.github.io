October 10, 2020 - Thursday
My school day was pretty short today, because I had already finished most of the work ahead of time earlier this week.
After school I listened and looked for more music.
The music I was looking for was things that I thought my grandparents would like, because I was planning to make them a CD.
Once I was tired of looking for music I took a nap.
My nap ended up lasting almost until dinner time.
At one point I woke up and I think I experienced sleep paralysis consciously.￼
It wasn’t very scary, but more just kind of bizzar how difficult it was to move.
After I ate dinner I listened to some music with my grandma.
We listened to some songs that she said were her favorite and then some that she had on CD.
Following that I headed home.
Once I got home my parents and I were going to watch a documentary, but we ended up leaving to go get ice cream first.
After we got back we started the documentary which was called “The Social Dilemma”￼ (2020).
Next I got ready for bed and then spent my last little bit of free time just hanging out.
Today’s bed time was very good.
