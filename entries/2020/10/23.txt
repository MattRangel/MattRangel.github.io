October 23, 2020 - Friday!
After dropping my brother off at his school I went to where my mom was having her church retreat to gibe her a few packages.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house I started my school day.
It was another pretty short one today since I had most of the work finished already.
After I was done with school I went to the store with my grandma so she could buy a few things for my birthday and some other stuff.
We were at Walmart for quite a but and by the time we were finishing up it was raining.
I loaded up the car then we dove back to her house.
Once we were back I waited a while for one of my teachers to post a test I needed to do.
After the test I watched the movie “Crocodile Dundee” (1986) with my grandpa.
Following that I got in the student pickup line at my brother’s school and waited for him there.
Next we went back to my grandparents’ house amd ate the lasagna my grandma made for dinner.
We waited a little while before eatting dessert after dinner, because we were all pretty full.
For dessert I had a scoop of strawberry ice cream, rice pudding, and a slice of apple pie.
Then my brother and I headed back home.
At the last gas station we pass before going home I stopped and bought a one dollar scratch ticket.
I didn’t win any money, but it was cool buying it.
Once I got home I just hung out in my room until my dad got back home.
For my birthday he bought me AirPods Pro.
Then him and I watched a movie together called “The Outpost” (2020).
After that I brushed my teeth then went back to the living room to watch another movie.
I was too tired though and ended up leaving.
It’s a good thing I don’t have to wake up early tomorrow, because it’s pretty late.
