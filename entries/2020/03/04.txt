March 4, 2020 - Wednesday
It was raining very hard when I woke up this morning.
It slowed down by them time I got in the car to go to school though.
At school I took the SAT test which took over half of my school day.
After it was over everyone taking it got released to go eat lunch.
After eating lunch with my friends we went outside and played hackysack for a bit.
During thr last two classes of the day I just chilled on my phone.
Once school was over I headed home where I went to my room and looked at social media stuff as well as youtube.
When my dad got home he started making dinner.
The fish, potatoes, and string beans he made were all very good.
After dinner my mom and I went outside to do our walk but changed our minds since it was raining.
I then did the dishes which didnâ€™t take too long today.
Once the dishes were done I got ready for bed then hung out in my room a little more till it was time for bed.
