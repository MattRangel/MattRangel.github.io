After waking up this morning I scrolled through my phone until I got hungry.
I got up to go look for somthing to eat for breakfast.
There wasn’t anything that appealed to me, and so I went outside to say hello to my mom who just got back home.
My mom and I then went on our walk down the driveway and back.
When I got back from the walk I felt down and didn’t want to go on my phone again.
So I sat at my desk for a while looking around at my room.
I then decided to text my friend Yamiel and see if I could come over to his house.
After him saying it’s fine I headed over to his house.
We played some video games, then watched the movie “Bandersnatch” (2018) on Netflix.
It’s a choose your own path movie that I had already seen but he had not.
Once the movie was done we went outside and played hackysack in front of his house.
After doing that for a while I was a bit tired and also pretty hungry.
At home I threw a frozen pizza in the oven and then put on thr movie “The Shawshank Redemption” (1994) to watch with my mom.
My mom had already seen the movie, but it was one that she liked.h
Also during the movie my mom got a text that said school is going to be canceled next week because of the Coronavirus/Covid-19
Following the movie my family all ate the dinner that my dad made.
For dinner was some stake and potatoes.
After dinner I hung out on my phone for a while before hopping out of bed to brush my teeth.
I went to bed late but not too late, and hopefully I’ll be able to go to bed even earlier tomorrow.
