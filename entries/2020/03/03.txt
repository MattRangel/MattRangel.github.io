During my science class I got a text that said that the “100 gecs” concert tickets I signed up to buy were successfully purchased￼.
That means all I have to do now is find a friend to go with.
In english class I wrote my poem which I choes to do over my switch to Taoism.
Then in math class I took a test which I was very confident about.
On the way to my grandparents’ house I listened to the “The Proclaimers” CD I bought this weekend.
The music was pretty good and I look foward to being able to learn the songs.
My lunch today at my grandparents’ house was cooked by my dad.
He cooked the lunch today because my grandmother had an eye surgery and had to rest.
I got to my house at a good time and was able to brush my teeth and wash the dishes on time.
I just stayed up too late messing with outfit things lol.
