March 20, 2020 - Friday
Once I woke up I had some dreams to write in my Journal.
Then I made a peanutbutter sandwhich for breakfast.
After eating I hung out in my room and played some Pokémon on my 3DS.
After playing for a while my mom called my brother and I to come work out with her.
She followed a workout routine off the TV which I didn’t really want to do, so I practiced hackysack while she did that.
By the time we were finished I was actually a bit sweaty.
So I took a shower and then went back to my room to play on my 3DS for a little bit more.
After that my day was a cycle between playing on my computer and my phone.
Later in the afternoon the rest of my family left to go to the store.
So I ate my lunch dinner during that time which was some reheated leftovers.
My dinner was just a bowl of cereal later in the night.
I’m also going to bed late again tonight.
