March 27, 2020 - Friday
I was going to work on homework after waking up today.
That didn’t happen though, because I instead went on my walk with my mom after brushing my teeth.
Then after the walk I stayed outside to play some hackysack for a while.
I played until my dad got home with the tamales he bought for lunch.
So I came back inside and took a shower then ate some beef tamales.
Once I finished eating tamales and also some brownies I got started on my school work for the day.
It didn’t take too much longer than I thought it would, but pretty soon after I did finish my dad called me out of my room.
He wanted me to come outside and help him with the mowing.
I don’t mind mowing the grass it’s just the pausing what I’m doing that I don’t like.
There was a lot of mowing to be done and so that took up the rest of my afternoon.
We did get it all done though.
When I finally finished I came inside and took a nice cold shower.
Then I ate a couple more tamales and went to my room.
I watched the movie “Cool Hand Luke” (1967) which was a pretty good movie.
During the middle of watching it my dad finished making a dinner.
I was still full from the tamales though so I just ate a tiny bit.
Then I got my teeth brushed and finished watching my movie.
Once the movie was finished I wrote this up and then went to bed.
I’m actually going to bed before midnight in the first time in too long.
I’m planning start making a better point to go to bed at a good time again.
