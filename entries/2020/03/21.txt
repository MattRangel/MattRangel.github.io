When I woke up this morning I had another dream to write down.
I can definitely￼ see that my dream recall is improving since I’ve commited to making a point to write them down.
After getting out of bed I made myself a breakfast of oatmeal.
Then I went back to my room and played on my computer for a while and then got on my phone.
I cycled through those two things for the majority of today when I wasn’t eating.
I also played some more Pokémon on my 3DS at some point.
My lunch was made by my dad.
Then I ate my dinner a few hours later which was a hotdog sandwhich. (My chef skills are unmatched by anyone haha)
After eating my dinner I went back to my room, but not for too long because my brother made some muffins.
So I came out of my room to eat a muffin and then decided I might as well get ready for bed while I’m up.
Oncs I finished brushing my teeth I hung out for a little bit more and then actually went to bed on time for the first time in a while.
