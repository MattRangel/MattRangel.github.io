March 7, 2020 - Saturday
For breakfast this morning I heated up some spaghetti I found in the fridge.
Then I went to my room to play on my computer for a while.
My dad cooked up a lunch and then after my dad and I watched some TV.
After watching TV for a while it got to be time to go to church.
I was the one who drove to and from church today.
Once I finally got home I watched some more Netflix with my dad while he cooked dinner.
After dinner my dad and I finished the episode we were on then I went to my room.
I hung out in my room for a while until I got the energy to get up and brush my teeth.
I’m going to bed late again but still not too terribly late.
I also talked (texted) with my friend Jamie which happened over the duration of the day, so it makes more sense if I just summarize it here at the end of this entry.
Basically what happened was that we did get a time figured out to hang out.
The thing was that she wasn’t interested in being in a relationship and all that.
And to be fair I’m not even sure if I even want to be in a relationship with anyone right now either.
Anyways, I wasn’t too beat up about it, because that’s just kind of how I am and also I’m fine with being friends as well.
