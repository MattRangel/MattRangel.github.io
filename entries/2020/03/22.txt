March 22, 2020 - Sunday
I ate some microwaved taquitos for breakfast this morning and then went back to my room.
I wasnâ€™t in my room for too long though, because I went to go help my mom pull up church on TV.
We watched church on TV today because the real life church got cancelled because of the virus.
I ate my last orange ice cream bar towards the end of TV church.
Then I went back to my room until it was time to eat again.
My dad made some bacon and eggs.
My brother made the toast for everyone and I put the butter on the toast.
Then I went back to my room again until my dad made more food.
This time he made some soup.
Went back to my room (suprise suprise).
Then my dad made some chili and rice for the final meal of the day.
After dinner I went back to my room.
I went and walked with my mom after dinner at some point.
It was very dim outside the whole sky was very gray.
Then I came back inside and washed the dishes which took a pretty long while.
After dishes I got my teeth all brushed and cleaned my room.
