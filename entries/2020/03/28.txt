March 28, 2020 - Saturday
This morning I ate two of the tamales from yesterday for breakfast.
Then I went to my room and watched youtube, played on my 3DS, and also my computer.
(Iâ€™m up kind of late right now which makes it a little bit more difficult to remeber the order in which things happened.)
I went on my walk with my mom.
For lunch my dad made some beans, rice, and shredded beef.
And then for dinner I had a shredded beef sandwich.
I stayed up too late tonight because I got distracted playing Tetris and Minecraft on my computer.
So that means tomorrow will have to be the start of me going to bed on time.
