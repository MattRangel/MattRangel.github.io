March 31, 2020 - Tuesday
I woke up kind of late again today.
After getting up I put some things to give to my grandparents in my car and then headed over to their house.
I had to turn around though, because I forgot the trash in the garage and my brother accidentally brough food in the car that was meant for the house.
Once we got that all situated though we headed over to my grandparents for real this time.
When I got there lunch wasn’t ready yet, so I got started on my school work for the day.
I finished all my school work except for two classes and then ate lunch.
While I was eating lunch I got a phone call from my mom who said that school was cancelled for even longer all the way till May 4th.
After eating lunch I didn’t work on my school work, because I decided to take a break.
I finished the last two classes once I was back at my house.
In-between finishing each of my two classes work I went out to the living room to watch TV with my dad and brother.
They were watching the movie “The Hunt” (2020) which I had already watched on my own a few days ago.
So I didn’t really watch the movie I just sat out there on my phone.
Once the movie was over I got my teeth brushed then did my last class’ work.
Then I hung out for a little bit more before finally going to bed.
