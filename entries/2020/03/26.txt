March 26, 2020 - Thursday
I spent morning working on school work.
Obce I finished I drove over to my grandparentsâ€™ house.
Over there I ate and watched TV on my phone.
I also played on my 3DS for a little bit.
After getting home from over there I watched a movie.
During the movie I ate some ice cream and some crackers.
I came out a second time to eat some brownies.
After the movie I watched a youtube series about these guys exposing scientology.
I went to bed very very late today.
