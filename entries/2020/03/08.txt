March 8, 2020 - Sunday
Since my family and I all wemt to church yesterday we didn’t have to go today, and so the majority of my day was spent at home.
When I woke up I hopped on my computer then played some games for a bit.
Once I got hungry I went and made myself some breakfast.
After breakfast I hung out in my room for a bit until I started to not feel good for doing nothing.
I got up and went on my walk with my mom.
Getting back from the walk I stayed outside and played hackysack for a while.
My brother came out and joined me too for a bit.
I kept playing until my dad said the french toast he made for breakfast was ready.
After I ate breakfast part two I went back to my room and played on my computer and then phone some more.
Then I went outside and played hackysack some more.
My brother joined me again for a second round.
I came back inside and took a shower since I was all sweaty and gross from playing outside.
After my shower I saw I got a text from my friend Jamie who said I’ve got to meet her parents tonight since they’ll be gone tomorrow morning.
So I got dressed into nicer clothes than pajamas and headed over to her house.
At her house I chatted with her parents for a bit.
After her parents and I were done talking Jamie and I went ousite to the porch.
We actually talked for a good while until her mom said she had to come back inside.
I said goodbye to them both and then headed home.
On my way home I stopped at HEB and bought some icecreams for my family.
When I got home I ate my icecream, cleaned my room, and then got ready for bed.
I’m going go bed kind of late again tonight, but only by about two hours.
