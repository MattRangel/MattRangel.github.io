March 23, 2020 - Monday
After waking up and getting ready for the day I got started on my school work.
The work I had for today wasn’t very hard and didn’t take too long.
Once I finished all of the work for today I headed over to my grandparents’ house.
I checked the mail before leaving, but it had not been delivered yet.
At my grandparents’ I did the normal of eat wnd hang out.
On the way back home at the end of the day I checked the mail again.
This time it was not empty and had the game (Animal Crossing: New Leaf) I ordered last week inside.
When I got inside my house I fired up the game and played that for the rest of the night.
I actually got into it and ended up staying up kind of late.
Me getting distracted on my phone after brushing my teeth also did not help hahaha.
I’m very happy with my purchase though, and I think the game is really good so far.
