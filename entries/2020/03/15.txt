March 15, 2020 - Sunday
I woke up pretty early this morning considering how late I went to bed last night.
My whole day today was Netflix and scavenging for leftovers to eat in the fridge.
Besides watching Netflix I was also on social media stuff a bit.
The things I ate today were pizza, rice and beans, yellow rice, oatmeal, popcorn, and some marshmellows.
The popcorn I made at the end of the night.
I made it with sugar so cleaning the popcorn pot reminded me why I don’t use sugar more often.
After my popcorn I got all ready for bed.
I got into bed before midnight today which is good.
Today’s entry was another short one, because I didn’t have a very intricate￼ day as you can see.
