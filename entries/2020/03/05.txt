March 5, 2020 - Thursday
In the middle of the night I woke up to some family drama things.
Once I fell back asleep and then woke up again it was time to go to school.
I had a small outfit planned for today which I don’t normally do.
On the way to school I listened to some more of my “The Proclaimers” CD.
At school I walked straight to my first period class because the bell rang early today for some reason.
I got a lot of work done in first period which left me with no homework leftover.
In homeroom class I played some two player games on the computer with my friend Yamiel.
My friends and I all went outside to play hackysack after lunch just like normal.
Then in english I turned in a paper I already finished the other day and then went on my phone the rest of class.
In math class I did a notes paper and talked with my friends.
One of my friends in there I haven’t been talking to too much though and it feels not good.
History class I took notes just like the majority of days in there.
I also uncuffed my jeans during this period because they came up high while I sat down and felt funny.
After school I drove just myself to my grandparents’ house, because my brother was getting a haircut with my dad.
At my grandparents’ house I couldn’t really settle on anything to watch, which leads to me just wasting my time on social media and that kind of drains me after a while.
I did end up watching some videos about playing the piano and other music things though towards the end of the day.
I got home a bit late, because I took the long way home so my brother could rest in the car a little more.
Once I did get home though I went on my walk with my mom and then got ready for bed.
I’m really not going to bed at too bad of a time.
