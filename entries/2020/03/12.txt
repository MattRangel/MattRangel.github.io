March 12, 2020 - Thursday
I hung out on my phone for a bit before leaving to go to my grandparents’ house.
At their house I watched the movie “The Hateful Eight” (2015).
It was a pretty long movie so it took me a while to finish it, especially since I took a pause during lunch.
During lunch my dad called me to come drive my car to the inspection place he was at.
I already knew in my head how to get there and the inspection didn’t take too long so it wasn’t a bother.
After getting back to my grandparents’ house I finished the movie.
Then I started watching youtube videos about pianos and then guitars.
Once I got home I continued doing that for a while.
I was thinking about looking into starting to play one of the two, but got overwhelmed￼￼ buy all the different information and also the costs.
That did get me off my phone and out of my room to get ready for bed though.
I went to bed a bit late and also feeling not great for spending so much time on my phone instead of reading.
I’m going to try and make a better point tomorrow to not let that happen again.
