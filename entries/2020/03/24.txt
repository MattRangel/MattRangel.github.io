Today was my brother’s birthday.
After waking up I did all my school work for the day and then went on my walk with my mom.
Then I went over to my grandparents’ house.
The food wasn’t ready right when I got there so I hung out for a bit.
After eating I hung I went back to the bedroom.
Once my parents got there and finished eating we all sang happy birthday for my brother.
Then we ate dessert.
After all that my parents headed back home.
I stayed till dinner and I watched a movie on my phone.
At home I got ready for bed and then watched a movie with my brother and mom.
I’m going to bed pretty late tonight, but hopefully I won’t wake up too late tomorrow.
The movies I watched today were (in order): “Suburbia” (1983), “White Dog” (1982), and “12 Monkeys” (1995).
