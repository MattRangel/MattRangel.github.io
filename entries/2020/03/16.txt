March 16, 2020 - Monday
This morning I woke up real early to go with my mom and see some friends at starbucks.
I was too tired though and ended up going back to sleep.
Once I woke back up I watched some netflix then went to my grandparents’ house.
The lunch my grandma had wasn’t ready yet and so I had to wait a while.
I was very hungry by the time it was ready, because I didn’t eat breakfast.
I then watched netflix and did other social media stuff on my phone for the day.
At the end of the night I also told my grandma that I like a different kind of dessert which I’ve been meaning to for a while.
She has normally been giving me thoes cinnamon rolls, but I like oatmeal cream pies better.
Once I got home I got half ready for bed then ate some ice cream.
After the ice cream I finished the other half of getting ready for bed.
I didn’t go to bed immediately￼ after that though.
I stayed up for quite a while.
Me staying up late did let me go on my walk with my mom so that’s a positive.
I’ve got to wake up early tomorrow morning for a dentist appointment.
Hopefully I won’t be too super tired.
