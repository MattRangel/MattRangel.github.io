March 29, 2020 - Sunday
After waking up this morning I hopped on my conputer and played some tetris and minecraft.
I played thoes two things for a while till my mom said I was time to watch church on TV (Still no church because of virus).
Once church was over my dad made a breakfast and then I went back to my room.
I played on my computer for a while more until I decided to watch a movie.
The movie I chose to watch was “Kill Bill: Vol. 1” (2003).
In the middle of watching that movie a couple things happened.
First my dad made dinner which was pasta with meat sauce.
Then I later went on my walk with my mom.
My brother joined us for the walk today and played frisbee with mom while we all walked.
After I finished that movie I started “Kill Bill: Vol. 2” (2004).
By the time I finished that movie it was kind of late, but still before midnight which was good.
So I wrote up this, got all ready for bed, cleaned my room, and then went to bed.
While cleaning my room after writing this I got stung on the hand by a scorpion.
It wasn’t a very big one though so I didn’t hurt for too long.
