March 14, 2020 - Saturday
I spent my morning watching Netflix.
For breakfast I ate some of the pizza I heated up yesterday then ate some apple pie.
I then mowed outside with my dad for a while this afternoon.
After mowing I went back to hanging out in my room, but not for too long since it was time to leave for church a little after.
After church my dad and I went to the store to buy a few things.
There was a bunch of empty shelves at the store, because of the virus going around.
Once I got home I went on my walk woth my mom then came back into my room.
I stayed up pretty late tonight and so it made it kind of hard to remember the small details and specific order things happened.
