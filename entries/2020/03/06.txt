March 6, 2020 - Friday
Today was the last day of school before spring break.
During my frist period class I had a test which ended up being not as hard as I thought.
Then the next two periods I played computer games after finishing my work.
English class I chose to still read my book even though I would’ve gotten away with going on my phone if I wanted.
Then in math class I just watched the movie that the teacher put on.
In history we played Jeopardy which my team was pretty good at.
We basically had the game won already by the time￼ it was only half over.
Getting out of school didn’t take too long, but I still got home kind of late because I took the long way home in order to avoid construction traffic.
While I was in my room after getting home I decided to text my friend Jamie to see if she wanted to hang out sometime over the break.
I then went on my walk with my mom.
Following the walk I played some hackysack outside with my brother and mom￼.
After coming inside my dad had dinner ready.
So we all sat down and ate the meatballs, rice, and string beans that he made.
Once dinner was over I went to my room and played on my computer.
I actually got sucked into what I was playing (Minecraft lol) and ended up going to bed pretty late.
Or at least pretty late for me that is.
