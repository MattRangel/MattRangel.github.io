March 2, 2020 - Monday
On the way to school this morning I played one of the CDs I got at the book store this weekend.
Once I was at school and sitting down before my first period started I signed up to autobuy the tickets to a “100gecs” concert for when they go on sale tomorrow.
I signed up to buy two but I’m not certain on who I’d want to bring with me to go see them yet.
Took a quiz in science class which was real easy then I started on the test review.
In my next few classes I chilled out because they aren’t very hard.
After lunch my friends and I all went outside to play hackysack again.
It was pretty nice weather outside today not too hot or too cold.
In english class I did some quick write things which were not too hard.
I think that’s because writing out stuff comes easier to me since I write these entries every night.
Math class I did another test review for the test tomorrow.
I got out of school and to my grandparents house quick amd easily.
Over there I spent the majority of my time working on finishing my math test review.
It took a while because I was distracted watching stuff on my phone while I worked.
I got home at a resonable time that let me wash the dishes and get ready for bed on time.
So that means I’m not going to bed late tonight like I have been the past few days.
