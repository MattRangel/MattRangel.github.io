March 17, 2020 - Tuesday
This morning I got woken up real early to go to my dentist appointment.
I had no cavities which is good.
After the appointment I headed over to my grandparents’ house.
Over there I ate breakfast and then hung out.
Once it got to be time for lunch I didn’t really eat, because I was still full from eating breakfast.
I hung out some more after eating lunch, but then I got tired so I took a nap for a bit.
A little while after I was done sleeping I drove to go get pizza for dinner.
I took the pizza back to my grandparents’ house and then ate up.
It wasn’t really night yet when I finished eating so I hung out over there for a little more.
On the drive home it was raining really hard.
At home I got ready for bed then played on my computer for just a bit.
Then I tried to watch a movie, but it wasn’t that great.
So I hung out in my room for a while more till my mom got home.
When she got home I went on my walk with her, and then went to bed.
