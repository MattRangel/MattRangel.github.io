March 9, 2020 - Monday
I woke up a little to early today so I tried to lay in bed a little more, but couldn’t fall back asleep.
When I did get up I just hung out in my room till it was time to go to my grandparents’ house.
At their house I ate a small breakfast of some fruit and yogurt.
After breakfast I sat on my phone for a bit more until it was time for me to leave to go pick up my friend Jamie.
I picked her up from her house then we went shopping around at a couple thrift stores and also walmart.
Half the places we tried to go to were closed on Mondays though which was peculiar.
We also went and ate at this cool café which I didn’t even know existed.
We drove around listening to music and talking for a while too.
After I dropped her off I headed back to my grandparents’ house.
I wasn’t too hungry so I didn’t eat immediately after getting there.
Instead I watched the movie “Joe Dirt” (2001) which Jamie recommended earlier in the day.
Following that movie I ate my lunch and watched the movie “Falling Down” (1993).
Both the movies I watched today were pretty good ones they were different genres so good in their own way.
Once I got back to my house I messed around with the light bulb I bought earlier and the two that I already had.
So I’ve now got green, red, and pink lightbulbs.
I’m going to bed an hour late, but that’s better than yesterday.
