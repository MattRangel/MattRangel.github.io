March 11, 2020 - Wednesday
This morning I finished reading my book about Dreaming and started reading another book about the history of animals being criminally punished.
After reading for a while I cleaned and refilled one of my fountain pens that had dried out.
By the time I finished I was kind of hungry so I ate some SpaghettiOs for breakfast.
Then I watched a movie which I stopped in the middle of to walk with my mom.
After walking with my mom I bought the notebook/journalI was looking at on the internet yesterday.
I then finished watching my movie.
My dad then called￼ me out to the kitchen so I could watch the food in the oven for him.
Once the food finished cooking he prepared it up all nice and then we ate.
I went back to my room afterwards and ended up canceling my journal purchase.
I did that because I impulsively bought￼￼ it and it was also quite a bit of money.
Rest of the night I hung out in my room watching youtube and other social media things.
I did come out a few times though to eat and also brush my teeth.
I’m going to bed very super late tonight, and so I have really got to make sure not to do that again tomorrow.
