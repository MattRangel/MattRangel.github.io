March 1, 2020 - Sunday
This morning after brushing my teeth I hopped on my computer and played minecraft for a while.
Once I finished building the house I was working on I shut down my computer and went to eat breakfast.
For breakfast I made a microwave pot pie and some tea.
I watched youtube while I ate and countined for a bit after I ate.
Then I made some popcorn and pulled up the movie “No Country for Old Men” (2008).
I also drank the tea that I forgot I made during breakfast while I watched the movie.
I took a break in the middle of the film to go outsidf with my dad and practice driving the new lawn mower he got.
I was able to finish the movie before it was time to leave for church.
It was pretty good and I rated it 7/10.
After church my dad and I went to HEB to get some things to make dinner.
The dinner my dad made was cauliflower￼ soup, sweet potatoes, and chicken.
After dinner it was time for me to do the dishes which took quite a long time.
By the time I finished getting ready for bed after doing the dishes it was about twenty minutes after I would’ve liked to go to bed.
