March 10, 2020 - Tuesday
This morning after I woke up I got on my phone for a bit.
After brushing my teeth I didn’t feel too good and so I decided to not mindlessly scroll through my phone and instead do other stuff.
I read for the rest of the morning before I left to go to my grandparents’ house.
Once I got to their house lunch wasn’t ready yet so I read for a little bit more.
My grandma cooked some gumbo for lunch which was very good espically since I kinda felt like eating that today.
Then I watched a movie then read some more.
I then watched a second movie and then read even some more.
I got really tired and ended up taking a nap until it was time to eat dinner.
After eating dinner I headed back home.
At home I got distracted looking into buying a fancy leather notebook.
I brushed my teeth then browsed a bit more.
Then I read for a littlr bit before going to bed.
I’m also going to try and start writing down the dreams I have after waking up again in order to improve my dream recollection.￼
