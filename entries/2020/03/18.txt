March 18, 2020 - Wednesday
This morning I went out to the DMV with my dad, but it was closed.
We also got a few things at the store for ourselves and my granparents.
After dropping their groceries￼ off my granparents’ house we headed home.
At home I hung out on my phone for a while till lunch was ready.
My dad made beef, string beans, potatoes, and rice for lunch today.
After lunch I hung out in my room for a bit more.
At this time I also practiced drawing for a bit.
Once my mom got back home from the gym I went on our walk with her.
Following the walk I went outside to practice hackysack for a while.
After hackysack I ate some ice cream and then took a shower.
Then I went back to my room switching between playing on my computer and my phone.
I’m going to bed late again.
The break from school has also been extended by another two weeks.
