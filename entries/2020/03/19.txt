March 19, 2020 - Thursday
This morning I was getting ready to head out to my grandparents’ house, but my dad asked me to sweep up all the leaves on the patio.
It took a little while to finish but it wasn’t too hard.
After getting to my grandparents’ house I played Pokémon on my 3DS for a bit while I waited for lunch.
Once I finished eating lunch I played for a bit more then took a nap.
My teachers have started posting school work for me to do so I started that in a few classes.
I also went outside and cut some rosemary for my dad to cook with.
I stayed at my grandparents’ for a little later than I normally do.
When I got home I unloaded the stuff I was holding and then hopped in my bed.
At some point my mom called for me making sure I knew that school work was being posted for me online.
Since I was up now I decided to get ready for bed and brush my teeth.
After my teeth brushing I came back to my room and sat on the floor against my bed.
I was planning to write my entry, but I got a little sidetracked and ended up buying “Animal Crossing: New Leaf” for my 3DS.
Once I did that I got back to the original plan and wrote up my entry.
Then I went on my walk with my mom.
Following the walking I went to bed.
This is definitely￼ one of my better going to bed on time days from the past few weeks of no school.
