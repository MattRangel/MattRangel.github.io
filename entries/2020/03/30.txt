March 30, 2020 - Monday
I woke up late in the morning today because I haven’t been sleeping a whole lot lately.
After I woke up I got started on my school work.
I finished it all except for two classes and then went to my grandparents’ house.
I played a little bit of tetris on my 3DS, but the main thing I did was just hang out on my phone.
Once I got home I ate some crackers and got started on the dishes.
After the dishes I watched the movie “In Time” (2011) with my family.
Following that I watched another movie about this dog.
By the time the second movie was over it was very late.
So I went right to bed.
