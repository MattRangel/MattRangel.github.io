March 25, 2020 - Wednesday
Once I woke up this morning I started working on my school work for the day.
It took way longer than I thought it was going to.
I ended up not finishing until the afternoon.
Just a little bit after I finished I went to the kitchen to help my dad cook lunch.
After we finished cooking I ate and then went to my room.
I came out a few times to eat more stuff.
My brother got a present in the mail which was this ping pong game that hooks to a door frame.
So I played that for a while with him till the ball broke off the string.
Later on I went on my walk with my mom.
Then I hung out some more and then went and did the dishes.
After the dishes I went to my room again.
I shouldâ€™ve brushed my teeth before going back to my room, because I ended up procrastinating that for a while.
Once I did brush my teeth I got back on my phone for a little while.
Then I wrote this and went to bed pretty late.
