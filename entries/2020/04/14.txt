April 14, 2020 - Tuesday
I woke up to my alarm this morning so that way I wouldn’t stay sleeping for too long.
After waking up I did my school work then watched some Netflix.
Once it got to be noon I got in the car and headed over to my grandparents’ house.
Over there I watched more Netflix.
I also helped my grandma cook dinner.
The thing we were cooking had the wax paper burn and get stuck to it, so it was all kind of messed up.
I cut off the burnt part though and it was fine.
Right when I got home I brushed my teeth then went on my walk with my mom.
It was pretty chilly outside which I thought was over.
After the walk I washed the dishes then went to my room.
I spent the rest of the night watching my Netflix show “Money Heist” (2020) and also just going through social media things.
I ended up going to bed pretty late, but I’ve still got my alarm set so I don’t sleep in too late.
