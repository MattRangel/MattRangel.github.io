April 16, 2020 - Thursday
Today was a pretty average day.
I started out my day by finishing my school work and the hang out on my phone for a bit.
Then I headed over to my grabdparents’ house.
Over there I did the usually of eat and go on my phone.
When I got back home from their house I went on my walk with my mom.
After the walk I brushed my teeth then went back to my room.
I did come back out of my room at one point to let my dad use my laptop.
I stayed up late again tonight and I’m not going to set my alarm like I have been, because I’m pretty tired.
