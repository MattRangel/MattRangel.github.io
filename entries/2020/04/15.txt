April 15, 2020 - Wednesday
I woke up to my alarm again this morning.
After I rolled out of bed I got on my computer and did my school work.
Once I was finished with that I ate some oatmeal.
Then I went to my room to hang out.
When my dad got back home I helped him cook the rice for dinner.
Then I went on my walk with my mom.
After my walk I went back to my room.
A bit later my mom asked me to drop somthing in the mailbox for her.
So I went on another walk to the mailbox.
I went back to my room after that, but not for long becauseI got bored with my phone.
So I went outside to go on another walk and then play some hackysack.
Once I got tired I went on another walk.
That fourth walk was three miles long opposed to the normal half mile that I do.
When I came back inside I ate some ice cream then did the dishes.
Following that I finished getting ready for bed then hung out in my room for the rest of the night.
I spent that time watching the movie “Good Time” (2017) and then just going through social media.
I’m going to bed kind of late once again.
