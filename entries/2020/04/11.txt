April 11, 2020 - Saturday
I woke up kind of early this morning and just hung out in my room for a while till I got the energy to get up and brush my teeth.
Once I did do that I went back to my room for a bit until my dad finished making lunch.
For lunch was toast, an egg, and bacon.
I then went back to my room for a while.
After a bit my dad called me back out of my room and asked me to drive him to the store.
So I drove him to the store, got gas, and then dropped off some things at my grandparentsâ€™ house.
Once I got back home I helped my dad cook the rice for dinner.
After dinner I went on my walk with my mom and ate jelly beans.
I came back in the house and then ate some marshmellows before going back to my room for the night.
I went to bed at an alright time.
