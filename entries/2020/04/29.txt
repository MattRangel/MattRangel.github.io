April 29, 2020 - Wednesday
After doing my school work this morning I went outside.
I practiced skateboarding, played some hackysack, cut my nails, and ate a banana.
I came back inside and hung out for a while before going back outside to play frisbee with my family.
After frisbee I put some coconut oil in my hair to make my scalp not as dry.
I let that sit for a while before taking a shower.
Once I was done with my shower I went back to my room.
Then I helped my dad cook lunch.
After lunch I listened to some music with my friend Sarah on and off for the rest of the night.
I ate a peanutbutter and banana sandwhich for dinner and then washed the dishes.
After the dishes I brushed my teeth and listened to some more music with Sarah.
Then I went to sleep at a pretty good time compared to the last few days.
