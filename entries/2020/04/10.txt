April 10, 2020 - Friday
After waking up and brushing my teeth this morning I went back to my room to watch a Netflix TV show “Money Heist” (2020).
After a bit my dad called me to come eat the lunch he made.
I went back to my room after eating lunch, but I wasn’t in there for too long.
My dad called me again to help him pressure wash the house.
That took up the rest of the afternoon.
When I finished my dad made quesadillas for dinner.
After dinner I got my teeth brushed then went back to my room for the rest of the night.
