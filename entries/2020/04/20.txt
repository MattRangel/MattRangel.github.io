April 20, 2020 - Monday
After waking up and brushing my teeth I got started on my school work for the day.
The work I was assigned for today wasn’t too difficult, but I am starting a big project in one of my classes coming up soon.
Once I finished my home work I put all the trash in the house into the outside trashcan.
Then I went back to my room to hang out until it got to be noon.
At noon I went over to my grandparents’ house.
For lunch over there my grandma made hamburgers.
Then for dinner I had waffles and a hamburger.
When I got home in the night a package was waiting for me at the gate.
When I came inside I went right to my room and opened up the hoodie that I ordered.
It says the word “SMILEY” in block letters that are filled in with smiley faces.
It was a little bit snug around my neck, but that wasn’t too big of a deal and I was happy.
I then went on my walk with my mom wearing my new hoodie.
After the walk I got the dishes done then brushed my teeth.
Then I just hung out in my room watching YouTube until I got tired.
I did go to bed before midnight tonight which is good.
