April 13, 2020 - Monday
I woke up early this morning not on purpose.
I did my school work then hung out for a bit till it was time to go to my grandparents’ house.
Over at their house the majority of my time I was watching netflix.
I also watched the movie “Killer Klowns from Outer Space” (1988).
After getting back home I washed the dishes and then brushed my teeth.
Then I watched “Money Heist” (2020) on Netflix some more.
I watched that for a bit until I did my walk with my mom.
After the walk I came back to my room and watched some more Netflix.
I ended my night playing Minecraft on my phone with my friend Sarah.
