April 8, 2020 - Wednesday
After I woke up this morning I got right to working on my school work.
Once I finished that I hung out in my room and watched the TV show “Money Heist” (2020)
Then I went out to eat the lunch that my dad made.
Following lunch I went back to my room to hang out for a little while more.
After a bit my dad called me out of my room to come help do some mowing outside.
By the time I finished that it was dark outside.
I took a shower then watched the movie “Uncut Gems” (2019) with my mom.
It was kind of late when I finished the movie so I did the dishes abd got my teeth brushed.
Then I went back to my room and stayed up for a little bit more before going to bed.
