April 26, 2020 - Sunday
I still woke up to my alarm this mornibg even though I went to bed late, but I didnâ€™t have too much energy.
Once I finially got up I brushed my teeth and ate some leftover pasta for breakfast.
Then I went back to my room.
I camr back out later on to eat pasta again for lunch.
Then I went to my room again.
My dad called me out to help him make dinner.
Once I finished eating dinner I washed the dishes.
Then I went to my room again and drew some things, but not for too long, because my dad invited me to come watch a movie in the living room.
After the movie I went and sat at my desk and wrote up a letter for my friend.
Once I finished the letter it was pretty late.
I cleaned my room, got ready for bed, and then went to sleep.
