March 4, 2020 - Saturday
Today’s isn’t going to be too detailed, because I’m going to bed late and don’t remeber the things that happened earlier in the day too well.
I just hung out in my room after waking which a little before noon.
That’s because my dad said he was going to make something for lunch so I just waited for that.
I watched the movie “BlacKKKlansman” (2018) today by myself.
I also watched the movie “Reservoir Dogs” (1992) with my family.
A little while after that I watched another movie with my family called “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” (1975).
By the time the second movie was over it was kind of late.
I went back to my room and stayed up for a while more though.
