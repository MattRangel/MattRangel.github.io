April 6, 2020 - Monday
I woke up kind of late today, but that’s good because I actually got a full night’s rest.
After I did wake up I made a timeline for my history class.
The timeline took a while because I was being perfectionist.
So I ended up not leaving my house to go to my grandparents’ house two or three hours later then I normally do.
When I got there I ate a bit over half what my grandma made for lunch, because I wasn’t too hungry.
After eating I procrastinated doing my english class work for a little while.
It wasn’t too hard though.
The task was just to answer four questions over a two minute video.
Once I was finished with that I played some iMessage games with my friend Sarah for a while.
Then I started watching the TV Documentary show “Tiger King” (2020).
Once I got back home I got the dishes done, brushed my teeth and then went on my walk with my mom.
After that I got on my computer and drew with Sarah again for a bit.
When we got off I went back to watching “Tiger King” for a while.
Then I had to brush my teeth again, because I ate some of the cheese things my dad made.
After that I wrote this up, then finished the episode I was on, and went to bed.
