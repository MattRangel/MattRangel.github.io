April 17, 2020 - Friday
Woke up feeling pretty rested this morning since I woke up on my own.
I just watched tv and hung out on my phone for the majority of today.
I reheated some beef tamales for breakfast.
ThenI went back to my room.
After a bit I watched the movie “Mud” (2012) with my mom on the tv.
We had to pause it half way through though because she had a video call scheduled with her friends.￼
During the break from the movie I helped my dad while he prepared dinner.
Once my mom finished her call we got back to the movie.
After the movie we went on our walk.
Then I went back to my room until it was time to eat dinner.
Following dinner I went back to my room for the rest of the night.
I stayed of kind of late tonight again.
I am starting to get tired at closer to normal times which helps be go to bed on time though.
