April 28, 2020 - Tuesday
After brushing my teeth this morning I walked down to the mailbox to put the letter I wrote for my friend Sarah in there.
Then I walked back to my house and got my homework finished.
Once homework was done I washed the dishes and then hung out for the rest of the morning.
I then left to go to my grandparents’ house.
After eating the lunch my grandma made we watched “Pirates of the Caribbean IV: On Stranger Tides” (2011).
The movie was pretty long so it was already late in the afternoon by the time it was over.
I helped my grandma cook dinner a little bit, but she saw that I was tired and told me to just go and rest.
So I took a long nap.
After my nap I took a shower and then ate dinner.
Once I got back to my house I went on my walk with my mom.
Then I did the dishes and brushed my teeth.
My mom and brother wanted me to come play frisbee with the for a bit so I did that next.
Afterwards I went to my room and facetimed Sarah for a while until she had get off the phone.
I stayed up for a bit after that before going to bed.
