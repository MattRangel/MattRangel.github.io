April 5, 2020 - Sunday
I was pretty tired this morning, but I still woke up early.
I for the morning I just layed on the ground in my room on my phone.
I didn’t really feel too hungry so I didn’t end up eating till my dad finished making lunch at around 3 in the after noon.
After lunch I went back to my room for the afternoon switching between my computer and my phone.
Towards the end of the afternoon I got on my computer and did this collaborative￼ drawing thing my friend Sarah.
After doing that for a while I went on my walk with my mom and brother.
We all played frisbee on the walk again like we have been the last few times.
Once I got back inside I got the dishes done then got ready for bed.
I then got back on my computer to draw with Sarah some more.
Doing that definitely￼ felt much nicer than just hanging out on my phone haha.
Once she said that she was getting off I figured I might as well go to bed aswell.
So I shutdown my computer, set away a few things, wrote this, and then went to bed at a not so super terrible time.
