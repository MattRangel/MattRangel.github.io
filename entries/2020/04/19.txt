April 19, 2020 - Sunday
I woke up to my alarm again this morning, but I actually wasn’t too tired this time.
I hung out until my mom said it was time to watch church on the TV.
During TV church I ate some reheated tamales for breakfast.
After church was over I went backto my room.
I stayed there coming out to eat every once in a while until my dad said it was time to mow some more.
There wasn’t that much mowing left to do though so I finished it all pretty quick.
Afterwards I took a shower then hung out some more.
I watched the movie “Swiss Army Man” (2016).
Towards the night I ate some left over pasta and brisket for dinner.￼
I went to bed even earlier then I did yesterday by about an hour or so.
I’ve been making very good progress on my sleep schedule fixing the past few days.￼
