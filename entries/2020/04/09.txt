March 9, 2020 - Thursday
I only had to do two classes worth of work today.
So I was easily able to finish it all before going to my grandparents’ house.
For one of my classes I finished a whole powerpoint not know that it was a multi-day project.
So that means I’m finished early now which is cool.
At my grandparents’ house I watched more of my show “Money Heist” (2020).
Once I got back to my house in the night I brushed my teeth.
Then I went back to my room and watched some more TV for a bit.
After watching an episode or so I went on my walk with my mom.
Then I came back to my room.
In my room I watched some more TV but also pulled out my melodica and practiced for a while.
It’s not actually as hard as I thought it was now that I know the keys are all placed in a pattern.
Once I finished playing my melodica I stayed up for a little more before going to bed.
