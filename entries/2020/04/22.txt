I didn’t have a whole bunch of school work to do today.
After doing my school work I stayed on my computer for a pretty long time.
And I wasn’t just playing games today haha.
I was actually messing with a program I have on my computer trying to change something about it.
Although I didn’t get what I wanted to work I did learn quite a bit about how browser extensions function.
I took a break from my computer to eat breakfast tacos my dad made a one point during that.
Once I was done on my computer I went back to hanging out on my phone.
My mom and I made some milks from plants today.
First we made oat milk which turned out pretty cool.
The other one we made was chia seed milk which was definitely not as good￼.
The oat milk is something that I’d do again though.
In the night I watched the movie “Rosemary’s Baby” (1968).
There were a lot of dishes to be done, but I was able to finish them all while watching the movie.
After the movie it was kind of late so I got ready for bed, wrote this up, and went to sleep.
