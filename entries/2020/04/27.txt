April 27, 2020 - Monday
Woke up and did my homework this morning.
Once I finished I put all the trash in the outside trashcan.
Then I did the dishes and hung out until it was time to leave to my grandparents’ house.
Over there after eating lunch I was on my phone for a bit before I put on a movie.
The movie I put on was “Pirates of the Caribbean III: At World’s End”.
The movie was pretty long by the time it was over it was late in the afternoon.
Once I got back to my house I went on my walk with my mom.
Then I went to my room to procrastinate doing the dishes for a while.
After I finally did the dishes I brushed my teeth and wrote up this.
I went to bed kind of late again tonight.
