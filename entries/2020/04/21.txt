April 21, 2020 - Tuesday
After finishing my work for the day this morning I just hung out watching YouTube until it was noon.
At noon I went over to my grandparents’ house.
Over there I did my normal routine of eating and hanging out.
One difference today was that I put on a movie to watch with my grandparents.
The movie I put on was “Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl” (2002).
That’s was the first time I’ve seen that movie and I plan to put on the part two for us to watch on thursday.
Once I got home I went on my walk with my mom and then did the dishes.
The rest of the night I played some games on my computer.
I’m going to bed late tonight but not extremely late which is good.
