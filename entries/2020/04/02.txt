April 2, 2020 - Thursday
After I waking up I got started on my homework.
I did better at staying on task today.
My brother and I didn’t go to my grandparents’ house today.
So after homework I just played on my computer for a while.
I’ve been playing a bit more minecraft these past few days.
I did that till around noon when I took a break to go eat.
My dad also made a dinner which was really good.
I watched a couple movies today.
The first movie I watched was with my mom.
The second movie I watched later in the night was with my dad.
I’m going to bed late again tonight, but I plan to sleep in a little so hopefully I wont be exhausted.
