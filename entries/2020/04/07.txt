March 7, 2020 - Tuesday
I woke up at a pretty good time today.
That let me get all my school work done before I left to go to my grandparents’ house.
Over at their house I finished watching the TV show “Tiger King” (2020).
After I finished that I took a break from watching movies and tv shows for a little while.
After the break I watched the movie “Parasite” (2019).
Once I got home I got my teeth brushed and did the dishes.
I then waited for my mom to be ready for our walk.
Following our walk I went back to my room and just hung out for the rest of the night.
Tonight is also another day of me not going to bed at too crazy of a time.
