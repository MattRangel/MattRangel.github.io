April 3, 2020 - Friday
It was decided to go to my grandparents’ house today since my brother and I didn’t go yesterday.
I also woke up a bit late so I only had time to do two classes worth of work before leaving to go over there.
Over there I finished my school work and startet watching the movie “Apocalylpse Now” (1979).
I actually started it yesterday, but I only watched the first five or ten minutes and then stopped because the TV program crashed.
Once I got home I got started on my movie again.
Pretty soon after I finished the movie my dad found one to watch with the family.
By the time that movie finished it was pretty late so I got my teeth brushed and went to my room.
I hung out in my room for a little bit before going to bed.
