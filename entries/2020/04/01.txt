April 1, 2020 - Wednesday
This morning I went to try and do my school work, but the website was broken so I ended up playing on my computer for a bit.
Then my mom invited me to go out to the store with her, so I went and ran errands with her.
We didn’t get home till a little bit into the afternoon, but I still had fun.
Once we did get home I sat down and ate some of the crazy cereal we bought.
After that it was finally time to do my homework.
It took me a while to finish it all, but that’s all on me because I kept getting distracted lol.
Right after finishing my homework I went out to the living room to watch a movie with my mom and brother.
We took a pause during the middle of it so my mom could video chat with her friends.
Once the movie was over I went back to my room, but not for long as my mom wanted to go on the wall.
I didn’t mind though and my brother came today, so it was cool getting to play frisbee.
After finishing the walk I put on a movie I started watching yesterday and did the dishes.
Following that I drank some tea then went back to my room to finish the movie.
I got up and brushed my teeth once I finished the movie.
After brushing my teeth I went and sat at my desk and got on my computer.
I got back to working on this special calculator I was making for myself.
I ended up making two and spending a very long time working on it.
It finally got finished super late into the night.
But I’m very very happy how it turned out.
