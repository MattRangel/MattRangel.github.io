April 12, 2020 - Sunday
I slept alot tonight.
After waking up I watched some netflix.
Then my mom came and asked me to watch church with her on the TV.
During TV church I ate jelly beans.
Then I went back to my room to watch some more “Money Heist” (2020) on Netflix.
The show has more episodes then I thought it did.
My dad made the lunch and dinner for my family and I today.
I went on my walk with my mom and my brother also joined.
We all played frisbee together during the walk.
After the walk I brushed my teeth and washed the dishes.
Then my dad put on the movie “Little Women” (2019).
I finished eating my jellybeans during the movie so I had brush my teeth again.
Then I went back to my room and watched a little bit more netflix before going to bed.
