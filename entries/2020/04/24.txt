For breakfast this morning I reheated sone soup that my grandma gave me on Thursday.
After breakfast I went to my room and watched some TV shows on Netflix.
Once it got closer to lunch time and I was hungry again I reheated the rest of the soup left and ate that.
Then I went to my room again to watch some more Netflix.
My dad called me out of my room later on to come help him make dinner.
The dinner that we made was pretty good and I also learned some about how he makes some of his foods.
Once I finished eating the dinner I made I went to my room and hopped on my computer.
There was a music festival on Minecraft that I had been planning to see for a while.
So I spent the rest of the afternoon on my computer listening to all the songs.
When it was over I stayed on my computer for a bit longer playing games.
By the time that I got off and got ready for bed it was late in the night.
Or at least late for me haha.
I also didn’t do my walk with my mom today, but I’m planning to just make up for it tomorrow and do two in one day.
