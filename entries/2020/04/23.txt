April 23, 2020 - Thursday
I finished the little amount of school work I had left this morning after waking up.
A little bit after that I helped my dad do some things on the computer and put new registration stickers on the cars.
After that I headed out to my grandparents’ house.
Over there my grandma had shrimp, vegetables, and rice for lunch.
She also had some cookies that she baked herself.
Following lunch I watched the movie “Pirates of the Caribbean II: Dead Man’s Chest” (2006).
During the movie I ate a coconut popsicle and another cookie.
After the movie I took a long nap.
For dinner my grandma had shrip and pasta made.
Once I got home I went on my walk with my mom and then got ready for bed.
For the rest of the night I just hung out until I got tired.
