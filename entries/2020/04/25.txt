April 25, 2020 - Saturday
I didn’t have my alarm turned on and was going to sleep in this morning.
That didn’t happen though, because three minutes after my alarm would’ve normally went off my dad woke me up.
He wanted me to drive him to the store.
So I got ready and brought a banana and a granola bar to eat while I waited for hin.
After we got back home from the store he made breakfast.
Following breakfast I went on my walk with my mom.
That walk was to make up for missing yesterday’s.
After that I went to my room and watched Netflix for a while.
Later on my mom came and told me I had to sweep around the house.
Once I finished sweeping I went back to my room.
Then after a bit my dad made lunch for everyone.
After lunch I went on my second walk with my mom.
I went back to my room after finishing the walk.
Then I came back out of my room to bake some cream puffs.
They turned out pretty good, but I was full by the time they were done from eating snacks while I waited.
Once I was done being a baker I went back to my room.
I stayed up pretty late tonight, but hopefully that wont cause me to sleep in too late.
