April 18, 2020 - Saturday
For my breakfast I made some microwave ramen with peanut butter.
After breakfast I went back to my room.
I hadn’t been in my roomfor too long when my dad called for me.
He wanted me to go out and do some of the mowing.
I threw on my mowing clothes, put on some music, and then got to work.
We took a break to eat dinner which was tacos using the brisket￼ from yesterday.
Once dinner was finished I got back to work.
I actually finished the entirety of the backyard which was pretty cool.
￼Once I finished working outsise a I came back and took a shower.
I left some coconut oil in my hair for a bit before taking my shower.
I did that because my scalp is dry.
After the shower I pulled up a movie for the family that my brother found.
We stopped it right at the beginning though to go get some ice cream first.
Once we got back and finished the movie I was already ready for bed.
That’s because I was brushing my teeth while I watched the movie.
It wasn’t even midnight yet when we finished the movie, but I was too tired to stay up any later.
That’s because my plan of waking up early so I’m tired at the right time in the night is working.
