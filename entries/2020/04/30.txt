April 30, 2020 - Thursday
This morning I woke up an hour earlier than I normally do.
So after I got my school work done I had a lot of time left over before going to my grandparents’ house.
Over at my grandparents’ house I listened to music with my friend Sarah by just pressing play at the same time to the same albums or playlists.
Then I watch the movie “Pirates Of the Caribbean V: Dead Men Tell No Tales” (2017).
After the movie I chatted abd watched Netflix some more.
Then I took my shower and ate dinner.
Once I got home I brushed my teeth and then listened to some more music with Sarah before calling with her for a little bit.
After phone calling we went back to listening to music together for the rest of the night.
We took a break at one point so I could go on my walk with my mom and brother.
