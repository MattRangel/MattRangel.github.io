January 19, 2020 - Sunday
I woke up kind of early today considering I went to bed around midnight.
I went to spanish church with my brother and grandparents.
After chirch we went and got pizza.
I just hung out on my phone till it was time to take my brother to church class.
Once I got back home after dropping my brother off I watched a little bit of netflix with my dad.
When my mom and I both finished eating dinner we went on our walk.
After the walk I did the dishes, got ready for bed, and cleaned my room.
I’m not going to bed at a very good time though because I didn’t make too good of an effort.
