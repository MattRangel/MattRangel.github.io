January 30, 2020 - Thursday
It was a pretty cold day today outside it also rained a bit which added to the dim vibe.
During my 2nd, 3rd (which is homeroom), and 4th period I was playing old arcade games on the computer.
Thoes old arcade games have a lot of lights and stuff going on in them, and I think it turned my brain into mashed potatoes more than it was already.
The only school tests I had today were in english and statistics and I passed both of them.
So I’m pretty happy about that.
Also in my statistics I gave Jamie my iPod Nano to see if she can fix it for me.
It’ll be really awsome if she is able to fix it.
I’m going to bed quite a bit late tonight which isn’t so cool.
I’ve got to wake up at 4am tomorrow to leave to California with my sister, but hopefully I will not be too tired.
