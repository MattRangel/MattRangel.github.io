January 25, 2020 - Saturday
My brain/body still woke up at 7:30 even though I went to bed real late last night.
So I didn’t have a whole bunch of energy throughout the day.
I just layed around on my phone until it was time to go to church.
After church my mom, dad, and I went to a mexican restaurant to hear a friend of my mom play music.
For dessert at the restaurant I got fried cheesecake which was good.
On our way home from the mexican restaurant we stopped at HEB so my dad could get a few things.
My mom and I got some ice cream there.
During the drive home I got a bit of a stomach ache because I ate too much and reading my phone in the car.
I’m going to try and not go to bed too late tonight but we’ll see how that goes.
