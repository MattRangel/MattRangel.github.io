When I woke up I remebered having a dream which does not usually happen, but I forgot it pretty quickly.
I think me remebering my dream has somthing to do with me going to bed pretty late last night.
It was rainy and dark all day today which blocked me and my friends from being able to play hackysack after lunch.
In science class we were doing small labs and the teacher had this big static electricity generator that would shock you when you touch it.
That was cool.
It took a pretty long time to get out of the parking lot at school today.
So I didn’t get home till about 5:30.
After I ate the meatballs and soup my dad made I went to my room and watched some youtube (what a suprise haha).
I did that till about 7 and then I washed the dishes and got all ready for bed.
Now I’ve got a little more free time before I go to bed on time.
