Today wasn’t too bad of a school day.
In homeroom I played some three player games on the computer with two of my friends.
I though that I was going to have an english test but I actually didn’t.
Instead during english we just read an assigned reading book which I actually read the chaper today.
I got a 100% on the math test that I took last week.
After school I was able to get out of the parking lot quickly.
At my grandparents’ I did the normal sequence of eating and going on my phone.
Tonight I got all my things done in time but I’m still probably not going to go to bed exactly on time.
Although I do have a bit more motivation than yesterday and I think I’ll go to bed on time tomorrow.
