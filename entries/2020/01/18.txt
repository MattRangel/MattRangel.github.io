January 18, 2019 - Saturday
After I woke up this morning I hung out in my room till around 12.
After that I drove to my grandparents’ house with my brother to go see my sister.
After eating lunch over there I went to my grandparents’ backyard.
Out there I put together my skateboard using the stuff I got and the stuff my dad got for me way back in october.
I did very good at putting it together and I’m very happy how it turned out.
I skateboarded around the neighborhood for a bit with my brother untill I got tired and went back inside.
Once we all finished eating dinner my mom, sister, brother, and I all played a drawing game kind of like pictionary (It was called “Drawful 2”) on the TV.
We played that until it was time for my mom to leave and then switched to a different game after she left.
My brother and I are spending the night at my grandparents’ tonight.
I’m not going to bed at such a good time tonight.
Hopefully I’ll be able to go to bed at a better hour tomorrow night when I’m at my own bed.
