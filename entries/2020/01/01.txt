January 1, 2020 - Wednesday
As you can see starting this year I’m going to start putting the day of the week along with the date up at the top.
This is going to help give context about some things I write about like when I reference to “this weekend” and stuff.
Anyways, back to what happend today.
This morning I tried to cut my hair but I messed it up and then messed it up again so I ended up with my head shaved all the way.
After that my dad, brother, and I all went to go eat pizza.
Once we got home from that I spent the rest of the night watching television.
