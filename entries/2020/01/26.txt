January 26, 2020 - Sunday
This morning I had a dream that I was put under anesthesia￼.
It felt like it was real simillar to the time they did it to take out my wisdom teeth.
For breakfast I made myself a peanut butter sandwich and then went on a walk with my mom.
On the walk I ate one of the orange ice cream bars I got yesterday.
After I got back from the walk I just chilled for the rest of the morning.
In the afternoon I went outside to the garage￼ to help my dad fix the inside of the car.
Once we finished that we went to go and eat at a burger place.
We got back home at about 8pm and I got ready for bed.
I’m going to go to bed on time today for sure because I don’t want to be sleep deprived when I go on the road trip with my sister on friday.￼
