January 20, 2020 - Monday
This morning when I woke up I just watched youtube and didn’t do too much till it was time to go to my grandparents’.
At my grandparents’ I did the usual of going on my phone and eating.
The main thing I did on my phone today was watching old live streams of a minecraft youtuber.
When I got home I did the dishes and the brushed my teeth.
I’m not going to bed exactly on time today though because I’m not feeling too motivated.
