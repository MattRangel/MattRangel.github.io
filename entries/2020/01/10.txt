January 10, 2019 - Friday
I fell asleep without writing this one, so I’m writing it the morning after.
During school it was pretty windy and also dark/cloudy.
My friends and I still went outside after lunch to play some hackysack though.
After school my brother and I drove straight home to start packing.
The plan was to go to Houston to meet up with my sister who is visting for a temp job.
Once my brother, my mom, and I finished packing we hit the road.
It took me a little over three hours to do the drive to Houston.
When we finally did get to Houston we bought our hotel for one night and then went and picked up my sister from her AirBnB.
After picking her up we all went to eat dinner at this place that had a ton of light bulb decorations and was on “Edison” street.
Following dinner we went to HEB to get a few snacks and then headed back to the hotel.
At the hotel I stayed up for a little bit eating candy and popcorn.
Once it got kinda late I got ready for bed and then zonked out on the bed.
