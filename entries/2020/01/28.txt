January 28, 2020 - Tuesday
During the night it rained but only half the dirt of my car got cleaned away from it.
I brought the gummy bears that my grandma gave to me to school today.
I ate too many though and I got a stomach ache after I ate my lunch of mashed potatoes and chocolate milk.
I can’t really think of anything else that really happened at school today.
At my grandparents’ house after school I did the usual of go on my phone and eat.
I did leave their house a little bit later than I usually do but it’s fine because I still have time to go to bed on time.
I also read a bit more about Dudeism/Taoism things which I often forget about for longer than I’d like.
