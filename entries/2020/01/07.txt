January 7, 2020 - Tuesday
This morning I woke up pretty late at around 12 or 12:30.
Right after I woke up I got ready for the day and went to my grabdparents’ house for the day.
It was an average day at my grandparents’.
My dad left my grandparents’ house with my brother abd I today because, my dad dropped off the car that he drove there in at the rental place.
We had a rental car for a while because my mom’s car had been in the shop for a bit.
When I got home tonight I immediately￼ got ready for bed and did the dishes.
I‘m going to go to bed on time today because I’ve got school starting back up tomorrow.
