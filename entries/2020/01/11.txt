January 11, 2020 - Saturday
This morning I woke up kinda early even though I went to bed late.
Once everyone else woke up my sister, mom, brother, and I all went to La Galleria in houston.
The plan was to just return one thing but we ended up staying and looking through the different shops for a few hours.
When we finally finished there we went to a park and rode some rented bikes around.
The bike riding got me real tired probably because I’m not too active and I didn’t get too much sleep.
Following the bike riding we all went to a pizza and pasta resturant for dinner.
For dessert we went to this frozen yogurt place.
That was the last thing we did with my sister before dropping her off and heading back home.
The drive home took about three hours which made me even more tired.
I’m not going to bed at such a good time tonight too.
