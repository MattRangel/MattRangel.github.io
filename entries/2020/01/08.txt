January 8, 2020 - Wednesday
Today was ny first day back to school after winter break.
I was not sure if I’d wake up to my alarm clock, because I’m not used to waking up so early.
My alarm clock did work though and I was able to leave the house on time.
At school a bunch of people commented on my new cut hair.
I’ve got a friend who got his schedule￼ changed around and he is now in my ELA class.
After school I was able to get home without getting stuck in the parking lot for too long.
At home my dad had a dinner of tomato￼￼ soup plus ravioli with salmon prepared.
After I ate dinner I went to my room and watched youtube on my phone.
I did that for about two hours plus a break when I went on my walk with my mom.
Following that I got ready for bed and did the dishes.
There was a ton of dishes to do, so those two things alone took two hours or right up till my time to go to bed.
(Note: I just realized I’ve been typing 2019 instead of 2020 since the 2nd of this month! lol)
