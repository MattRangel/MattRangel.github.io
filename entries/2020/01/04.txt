January 4, 2020 - Saturday
My family and I ended up not leaving houston this morning but at around 6:30 or so instead.
So during that time we just hung out some more like we did yesterday.
After tge long car ride home I brushed my teeth and then watched Netflix with my mom for the rest of the night.
Not going to bed very close to on time today.
