I played computer games with my friends at school today.
In english I read my own book and I got into it which was cool.
After school I got my oil changed which I wasn’t looking foward to.
It went real quick and smooth though so there really wasn’t anything to worry about.
After getting home I watched some Netflix with my mom.
Once we finished our show we went and got ice cream and then came back home.
At home we watched and movie on netflix.
I’m going to bed very late tonight.
