January 5, 2019 - Sunday
Today I woke up very late at about 1pm or so.
I didn’t get out of bed till about 3pm.
Once I ate “breakfast” it was pretty much time to go to church.
After getting home from church my dad made chicken wings in our new air frier.
Following dinner we all watched the movie “Yes Man” (2008).
When the movie finished I watched a television show on Netflix with my mom and then another one with my dad.
^I cannot remeber if I watched the tv show with my mom before or after we watched the movie.
