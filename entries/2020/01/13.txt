I woke up a bit tired this morning because I went to bed late last night.
My school day was pretty normal and wasn’t too hard.
During one of my classes I was texting with my mom and it turns out that I’m going to be able to drive to California with my sister at the end oth this month.
And then I’ll just get a plane for the way back.
After getting home tonight from my grandparents’ I got ready fir bed and did the dishes.
I was able to finish both those things quickly before my time for bed.
My dad bought ice cream for me but I didn’t eat any tonight because it was kinda late to eat and also I already brushed my teeth.
I’m going to bed on time today so that’s very good.
