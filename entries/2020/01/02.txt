January 2, 2020 - Thursday
This afternoon (I was asleep for the morning part of the day) I went to my grandparents’ house for lunch.
When I finished lunch I drove over to my friend Darious’ house to hang out with him and my other friend Ben.
Over there we played some pool and then after getting bored of that we went outside to walk around.
We only ended up walking a few houses away before we stopped to play four square with a basketball.
We played that until it became dark afterwards I went back to my grandparents’ house for dinner.
Once I finished eatting dinner I drove my brother and I home.
At home my dad and I watched a TV show late into night.
