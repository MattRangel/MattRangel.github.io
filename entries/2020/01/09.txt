This morning walking to school from my car I randomly met up with a friend.
A few minutes after getting inside another friend came and sat with us soaking wet.
It turns out that a few moments after finishing walking outside it started raining.
So we were pretty close to get wet.
In math class the teacher gave us new assigned seats.
Lucky for me the teacher put me with two other people who I was already friends with.
My portion of the day at my grandparents’ house followed it’s normal pattern.
After finishing eating dinner at my grandparents’ my brother and I drove home getting there at about 8pm or so.
When I got inside the house I got the sewing supplise and fixed the zipper on my backpack that had ripped a day or two ago.
Even though it took a long time and made me have to go to bed late, it felt pretty good to fix my bag myself.
I actually pretty proud of the job I did on sewing the zipper back.
You can hardly even see the part where it once used to be broken. B
