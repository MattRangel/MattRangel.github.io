January 29, 2020 - Wednesday
I woke up two hours early this morning and then couldn’t fall back asleep all the way.
It’s fine though because I didn’t feel to tired so I think it sill equaled normal sleep.
Anyway at school today I played an old game called “Bust-A-Move” on the conputer at school.
I like the game because it isn’t too dificult and I can kind of zone out.
In english class we did a paper which took a long time to do, but it didn’t really bother me too much because I got into the flow of working on it.
In my math class I invited the girl who sits by herself behind me (I’m going to call her “J” in this entry) to come and join my table while we work on the review.
After the bell rang to release us from class I asked J for her phone number.
I got her phone number and we texted a little bit.
At home after school I did my normal duties of eat, wash dishes, and brush my teeth.
After all of those I got on the phone with J while we both worked on school work.
We talked about some about the review questions, chatted a bit about other things, and also sat in silence some.
Even I got to bed a little later that I like to, I’m pretty happy with how everything played out today.
