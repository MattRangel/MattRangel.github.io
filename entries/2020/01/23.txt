January 23, 2020 - Thursday
At school in one of my classes this morning I was playing a game on the computer (it’s called “Pokemon Showdown”) with my friend.
He beat me at the game in all the rounds that we played.
Later in the afternoon I made plans to go and play basketball with some of my friends on saturday.
I was going to get an oil change on saturday but I decided to go on friday instead.
That’s because my brother is going with a friend after school so I’ll be able to leave from the parking lot quickly.
After school I texted a little bit with my sister about the type of snacks I like and also where we should stop for our half way point on our drive to california.
At home tonight I got all ready for bed with time to spare.
That means that I’m going to be able to go to bed on time tonight.
