January 12, 2020 - Sunday
I woke up early this morning considering the time I went to bed last night.
Utill it was time to go to church in the afternoon I spent the day just watching youtube and going on other social media things with breaks inbetween to eat.
For breakfast I ate some leftover soup and a peanutbutter and banana sandwich.
Then for lunch I ate a microwaved pot pie and also some pork (pretty sure that’s what meat it was atleast) my dad prepared after I finished the pop pie.
After church I got gas for my car and then drove home.
At home I ate some food my dad had prepared and then watched a few episodes of netflix with him.
I’m going to bed a little after I would have liked to but it’s not too late so I’m not upset.
