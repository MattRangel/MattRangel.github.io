January 6, 2020 - Monday
Today I woke up at a more normal time around 10am.
I waited around at home for a bit until my dad said we would drive seperately to my grandparents’ house, because he had to stay to pay our cleaning person.
It was a pretty normal day at my grandparents’.
I got my brother and I home at a good time that would alow me to go to bed earlier than I have been.
I of course did not use that time to go to bed though and stayed up late again.
I think it’ll work out fine.
