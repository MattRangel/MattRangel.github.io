I had am alright time at school today.
In most of my classes I’m not going to miss anything too important on friday which is nice.
I’ve been doing better at drinking more water during the day.
I still need to drink more that what I do though.
During my homeroom I played some multiplayer games on the computer with my friend.
The games were very simple math games so it was fun to try and do it very quick.
After school it took a very long time to get out of the parking lot which wasn’t too fun.
After I finished eating the meal my grandma made I chatted with a friend of mine for a bit.
We tried to get an app to work so we could watch a tv show together but it didn’t work too well.
After a while messing with other apps trying to get it to work it got to be too late.
So we decided to just try again another time.
My grandma gave me a bag gummy bears before I left which was very nice.
At my house I got my dishes done and my teeth brushed in a reasonable amount of time.
That means I’m going to be able to go to bed on time again.
