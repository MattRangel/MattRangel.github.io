January 16, 2019 - Thursday
Today was a pretty cloudy and foggy day.
I watched some cool videos on my phone today.
A few of them were about the Darién Gap which is a 60 mile stretch of jungle seperating north and south america.
The videos were showing how people would travel through it and the dangers they faced.
The other video I watched was of a guy who drove from Connecticut all the way to Panama and then back on a motorcycle￼.
I’m also successfully going to bed on time tonight.
I‘m starting feel a bit bitter now that I’m back on my sleep schedule.
The plan is to try and keep it good through the weekend, but we’ll see how that actually goes when the time comes.
