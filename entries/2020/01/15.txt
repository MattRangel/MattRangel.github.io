School today was alright.
A few of my classes like english and history are boring though.
When I got home from school my dad had dinner already prepared.
It was meat, an egg, some rice, and also squash.
After dinner I watched some youtube for a bit then ate some ice cream my dad bought for me a few days ago.
After I finished eating ice cream I did the dishes and got ready for bed.
Today I finished thoes two things with a bunch of time to spare.
So that’s nice to have some time to hang out before going to sleep.
I’m also going to sleep on time for the third day in a row now.
