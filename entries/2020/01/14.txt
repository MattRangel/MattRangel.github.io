January 14, 2020 - Tuesday
Before starting today’s entry I realized I’ve been putting 2019 instead of 2020 for the past four days.
By the time I get the hang of putting 2020 it’ll be 2021 haha!
Anyway, today at school during homeroom I played on my friend’s Nintendo Switch with him and another friend.
Then after lunch while I was playing hackysack I realized I’ve actually been improving quite a bit since the time I started.
At my grandparents’ house after school I did the usual of just eating, youtube, and social media.
At home tonight I finished washing the dishes and getting ready for bed with time to spare.
I’m thinking this’ll be the start to a good run of go to sleep on time days. B)
