I had a few tests in school today which I wasn’t looking foward to.
They both turned out pretty easy and I know I passed my science test and I’m almost certain that I passed my math test.
It felt good when I finally got them done.
After school my brother and I met my dad at Panda Express for dinner.
Once I got home from that I just chilled at home for the rest of the day.
I’m going to bed at a very good time today considering it’s the weekend.
