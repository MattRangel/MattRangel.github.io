August 3, 2020 - Monday
I woke up to my mom comming in my room this morning.
It was already kind of late so I started getting ready to go to my grandparents’ house.
Once I got over there I ate the shrimp, rice, and vegetables my grandmother made for lunch.
After lunch I watched some more of a TV show called “Wonderfalls” (2004).
I didn’t watch any movie with my grandparents today because I couldn’t think of one to choose.
I was thinking to put on the three stooges movie from 2012 on but it didn’t have the best rating so I decided not to.
For dinner I had the same thing as I did for lunch.
Once I got home I got ready for bed then washed the dishes.
After the dishes I worked some more at my defensive driving class.
I then ended my night off hanging out on my phone for a bit.
