I woke up late this morning, bevause I went to bed late last night.
My dad brought home some mexican food for lunch.
My meal was a steak burrito.
The rest of the afternoon I just hung out coming out of my room to eat the other half of my lunch at some point.
Once it got to be night time my dad called me asking me to help him outside.
I ended up spending the whole night out there with him working on stuff for a new zero turn lawn mower he just bought.
I was going to listen to/watch a music festival in minectaft, but It was already finisged by the time I was done working.
After I got back inside I took my shower then at a super late dinner.
For dinner I had beans, cornbread, and a croissant.￼
Then I got my teeth brushed and went to bed.
Both of those things weren’t very quick though, because I kept getting distracted haha.
