August 23, 2020 - Sunday
Today my dad, brother, and I headed back home from our trip to Iowa.
I was still sleeping when my dad woke me up to get ready to go this morning.
After packing my things and brushing my teeth I ate the breakfast my dad made.
It was rice and beans with hot dogs and also french toast.
We said good bye to my aunt, uncle, and cousin and then we were on our way.
My dad started off the drive so I used that time to get some more sleep.
We switched around for the rest of the day.
My brother even drove for a little list time.
For lunch we stopped at Jimmy Johnâ€™s where I got a plain ham and cheese sandwich.
I finished the last little stretch of the drive getting us home around midnight.
I got my things unloaded from the car and then got started on a computer project I thought of while I was in the car earlier.
I ended up working on that and also updating my computer for a really long time.
So today had a horrible bed time.
The thing I was working on was a DNS sinkhole which would block ADs for me.
Last thing I did was wait for my computer to finish updating and then I went to sleep.
