August 31, 2020 - Monday
This morning the plan was to go with my dad and get my car realigned, but he ended up saying he can just do it himself.
So I didn’t have to worry about going over to the car place and instead just went to my grandparents’ house which was nice.
He also put the trash bag in the trunk if the car for me.
Lots of nice things from my dad today!
The car ride this morning was just me, because my brother went to get a tuxedo fitted with my mom.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house I threw out the trash and then ate lunch.
After lunch I hung out waiting until it was time for me to drive to school and pick up my school computer and student ID.
The line was kind of long, but I wasn’t bothered.
Once I got back to my grandparents’ house I checked out my new computer.
Sometging wasn’t working with it, so I left it alone to charge the battery all the way.
Later on I set up the sprinklers to water the lawn.
Next I took a shower and then ate dinner.
After dinner I headed back home.
Once I got home I looked at my computer some more.
I ended up sort of figuring out what’s wrong with it, and I’m going to have to email someone about it tomorrow.
After that I was just hanging out when my dad asked me if I wanted a smoothie.
I said yes and it ended up being a blueberry smoothie.
I hung out some more after that before getting started on the dishes.
Before I got started I looked for something to watch and ended up choosing a movie called “Meantime” (1983).
Next I got my teeth brushed which took a little bit too long due to me getting distracted.
After that I was pretty tired, so I decided to finish the rest of my movie tomorrow.
