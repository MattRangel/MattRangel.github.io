August 25, 2020 - Tuesday
Before levaving to my grandparents’ house this morning I washed the dishes that I forgot about last night.
On the drive I timed the second way there with my brother, and we found out it was faster than the other route we sometimes take.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house I ate lunch and then hung out and watched YouTube for a while.
Later on I put on the movie “The Truman Show” (1998).
After that I hung out some more.
Once it was later and the sun was going down I set up the sprinklers to water the grass.
After I watered all the grass I took a shower and then ate dinner.
Back at home I waited for my mom to get back home after she left to go on a drive with my brother.
Once she got back I put on the movie “Sherlock Holms” (2009).
During that I also made some rice for my mom, which I’ll probably eat for breakfast tomorrow.
Towards the end of the movie I got started on washing the dishes and then I brushed my teeth.
Both of those things I got distracted in the middle of, so it took way longer than it should’ve.
I ended up staying up really late another day.
