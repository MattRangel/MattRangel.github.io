August 16, 2020 - Sunday
After waking up this morning I ate some leftover beans, rice, and meat from yesterday.
I just hung out for little while next before heading out to hang out with my friends Ben and Darious.
I went and picked up Darious then drove to Ben's house where we swam.
Once we were all tired and done swimming we dried off and then went to What-A-Burger for lunch.
Following lunch we all went over to Darious' house.
We didn't do too much over there, because we were all pretty tired.
Once I got back home I went to my room, but not for long.
My dad called my brother and I to come help him outside.
After I was finally done helping my dad outside I took a shower and then ate my dinner.
For dinner I had the same thing as I did for breakfast.
Then I finished gallon of banana ice cream my dad and I made the other day.
Next I moved the lawn mower back where it was supposed to go after running it for a bit to dry it off.
After that I got the dished done.
Following I went to my brother's room to wait for him to come back as a joke.
Once he came back and discovered me I went to my room and layed on my bed for a bit.
Then I got on my computer and played some Minecraft with my friend Sherry for a while before going to bed.
