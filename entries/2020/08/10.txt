August 10, 2020 - Monday
This morning I printed out my certificate that said I completed defensive driving.
Then I called up the court to verify how much money I need to pay for the ticket and if a money order would be fine.
A money order was acceptable, so I went to walmart along with my mom just in case who drove separately.
After we got the money order I gave my mom the letter so she could drop it off on her way back home.
And I headed over to my grandparents’ house getting there a little bit earlier than I normally do.￼
For lunch my grandma made lasagna.
After that I finished watching the movie “The Tragedy of Man” (2011) which I had started last night.
Following that I watched an episode of “Wonderfalls” (2004).
Then I started watching the movie “To Live” (1994).
I started watching it by accident while looking for a different movie by the same name.
But I kept watching it anyways because it seemed like a good movie.
For dinner I had the same thing as lunch.
Once I got home I washed all the dishes.
I then went to the bathroom to brush my teeth which ended up taking a really long time, because I kept getting distracted.
After finally getting all that done I sat down with my dad and helped him ask for a refund for something her returned on eBay.
Then I went to my room and finished watching “To Live” (1994).
Glad I decided to keep watching it, because it turned out to be a pretty interesting movie.
Afterwards I worked on trying to find somewhere to watch the movie “To Live!” (2010).
Which was the movie I was originally looking for earlier.
It was harder to find and I ended up just downloading the whole movie and adding the subtitle file to it myself.
I didn’t watch any of it and ended up going to bed after it was done dowmloading.
