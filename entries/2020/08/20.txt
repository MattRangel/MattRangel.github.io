August 20, 2020 - Thursday
This morning I stayed back while my brother and cousin Dagan went out to play Pokémon Go.
While they were gone I rode along to the store with my dad.
I didn’t go inside though, because I was on the phone with my mom helping her with computer things.
Once we got back to the house my dad and I spent a while cooking food for everyone.
For lunch we made pork and vegetables.
Then for dinner we made sone Chinese food.
Once I was done helping I played a game of Monopoly with my brother and Dagan.
Next we all played some minecraft together on the computers.
Following we played some footbag and then watched a movie.
I half watched the movie and texted with some new friends of mine.
I stayed up pretty late after the movie just because I was too lazy to get up and get ready for bed.
Definitely going to try to sleep at a better time tomorrow.
And hopefully I wont be too terribly tired when I wake up.
