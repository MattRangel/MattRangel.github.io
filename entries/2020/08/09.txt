August 9, 2020 - Sunday
I road along with my dad while he went to various stores this morning.
Once we got back home I went and hung out in my room for a bit.
My dad later called me to help him make lunch.
After eating lunch I went to my room and chatted with friends for a while.
I took a pause to go and wash the dishes that got dirty from lunch.
Following that I got on my computer and played some Roblox with my friends.
I played that for a while then once my friends had to get off I went back to just hanging out.
Before going back to that I ate a small bowl of ice cream though.
Later in the night I ate some left over rice from lunch for my dinner and then some more ice cream.
Then I came back to my room and started watching the movie "The Tragedy of Man" (2011).
Once I started to feel myself getting tired I pause the movie and got ready for bed.
I spent a little while more awake after that before going to bed.
