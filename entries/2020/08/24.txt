August 24, 2020 - Monday
I woke up to my alarm this morning, because without it I would’ve slept in way too late.
Once I was up I got my teeth brushed and took out the trash.
Before I left to go to my grandparents’ house my mom said she had a suprise for my brother and I somewhere.
We eventually found thecandies that she got for us.
My bag was  Hi-Chews.
At my grandparents’ house I ate gumbo for lunch wich my grandma made.
After that I pretty much just rested for the rest of the day.
I listened to some new music and watched YouTube.
For dinner I had some more gumbo.
Once I got home I looked for my car’s garage opener which ended up actually being in the car.
Then I went to my room and worked on my project from yesterday some more.
Later on I watched a movie called “Ava” (2020).
After the movie I went to my room.
I probably would’ve went to bed earlier if I just brushed my teeth then while I was already up.
My teeth still got brushed, but it was just later in the night.
