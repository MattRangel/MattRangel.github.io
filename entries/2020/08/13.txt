This morning I before going to my grandparents’ house I read sone, cut my nails, and started the movie “El día de la bestia” (1995).
After eating lunch at my grandparents’ house I finished watching the movie.
A while after that I went and played cards with my grandmother and brother.
Then I made some cookies with my grandmother.
After that I just hung out.
Once I got back home I watched a movie with my family that my dad found.
Following the movie I got ready for bed.
I ended up staying up for quite a while more before going to bed.
