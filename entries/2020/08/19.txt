This morning was all spent driving closer abd closer to Iowa.
In the morning when I brushed my teeth I swallowed my mouthwash instead of spitting it out, which ended up messing up my stomach later in the afternoon.
My dad and I switched back and forth driving the whole way.
Once we finally got to my cousin’s house I hung out for a bit and then went to the small down town.
It was just my brother and cousin Dagan who went.
I just followed them around while they played Pokémon Go.
After we got back home I ate the steak and potatoes my dad made for dinner.
Next I went downstairs and put on a movie to watch with my brother and Dagan.
The movie was alright, but I was tired so I ended up falling asleep towards the end.
Since I was so tired I got up and got ready for bed.
Then I came back to my bed to write this up, but I got kind of distracted looking at music things.
I found out a band (“The Zoltars”) I’ve liked for a while have a whole album I’ve never heard before.
