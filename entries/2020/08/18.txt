August 18, 2020 - Tuesday
Forgot to write this one the night of, so I’m writing this the next day.
Something happened and the meeting my dad and I had at Baylor got cancelled.
I still headed over to my grandparents’ house early like I had planned though.
After eating lunch my dad came over and dropped off some sprinklers for my grandparents.
I helped them get them all set up and then took a shower.
The rest of the day I just hung out like normal.
Once I got back home I brushed my teeth and got ready to drive to Iowa.
Once my dad, brother, and I were all ready we said bye to my mom and the hit the road.
I started off the driving and then took my first break around midnight.
