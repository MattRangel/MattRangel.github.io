August 11, 2020 - Tuesday
There wasn’t too much time to hang out after I woke up, because I slept in.
At my grandparents’ house after eating lunch I watched a movie.
The movie was the one I downloaded yesterday called “To Live!” (2010).
After that movie I watched the movie “Jumanji” (1995) with both my grandparents.
Following that I spent the rest of the afternoon playing on my computer.
I ended up staying over at my grandparents later than I normally do, because I got distracted playing.
Once I got home I did the dishes.
That took longer than it should’ve, because I got distracted looking at the ants we just found in our pantry.
After doing the dishes I ate a slice of cookie cake my mom got in the mail from her work.
Then I got my teeth brushed and ready for bed.
I spent the rest of the night hanging out on my phone watching youtube.
