August 5, 2020 - Wednesday
Today was my mom’s birthday!
I practiced my spanish reading and the played on my computer some in the morning.
For lunch my family all went to Fuddruckers for my mom’s birthday.
I got a bacon cheddar hamburger.
I didn’t know this before getting it, but you put your own toppings on the burger there.
So it was cool that I got a plain burger without having to ask.
After lunch we went to a cookie shop called “Mo Cookies” which was really good.
I got a ice cream cookie sandwich with smores cookies and coffee ice cream.
Once we all got back home I went back to my room.
I ended up starting a new projecting working on a website program.
My dad later asked me to do a bit of mowing.
I finished that quickly, because it was only a tiny bit he wanted me to do.
Comming back inside I took a shower and then got back to work on my project.
When my mom got back home from the store I took a break from working to go on a family walk.
After the walk I watched a movie with my mom and dad which I can’t remember the name of.
Following that movie I put on another one, but we were all tired so I decided to turn it off and just start getting ready for bed.
I got the dishes done first then brushed my teeth.
Went to bed very late tonight.
