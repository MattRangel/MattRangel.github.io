August 4, 2020 - Tuesday
I was hungry when I woke up this morning which I am normally not.
I ate a roll of bread and then went and hung out in my room for the morning.
At my grandparents’ house I ate lunch and then watched “Wonderfalls” (2004) on my phone for a while.
I later watched the movie “Men in Black” (1997) with my grandparents.
After the movie I worked some more at my defensive driving class.
Then I went back to hanging out on my phone.
After eating dinner and leaving I headed over to sonic.
I got on advertisement for a smores shake and wanted to try it.
And also to get my mom something since her birthday was comming up the next day.
I also let my brother pick something out and then we headed home.
Once I got home I watched the movie “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels” (1998).
I liked the movie a lot, my mom didn’t like it too much though haha.
After the movie I got the dishes done and got ready for bed.
I then stayed up for a littlr while more before going to sleep.
