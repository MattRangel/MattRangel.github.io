August 29, 2020 - Saturday
I woke up before my alarm this morning.
My dad came into my room to help him with a digital birthday card and to also help send a message on facebook marketplace.
For breakfast I made myself a bowl of oatmeal.
I then spent the rest of the morning hanging out in my room.
For lunch my dad asked me to make the rice and he made beans with corn, bacon, and eggs.
A while after going back to my room after eating lunch my dad called for my brother and I.
He wanted us to help him get rid of a pile of sticks outside.
That ended up taking my whole afternoon, and by the time I was done I was super tired and had a headache.
I took a shower then ate a slice of pizza and muffin which my brother baked.
Next I plopped back in bed and hung on on my phone for the next little while.
The rest of my family ended up going to the store later on, but I was so exhausted I decided to stay home.
While they were at the store my mom called me and got me a cotton candy icecream.
Once they got home I stayed in bed for a little bit more, but I did eventually get up to eat some of my ice cream.
After that I brushed my teeth and went to bed.
