August 15, 2020 - Saturday
I was going to sleep in this morning, but instead I got up early to my dad waking me up.
He was very tired and so I drove him around to a few places.
Once we got back homr he made ham and egg sandwiches for breakfast.
I then lounged in my room for a while, because I was still a bit tired.
Later on I drove my brother to a church thing and then I was going to hang out with Ben and Darious, but they both ended up being busy.
A while after I got back my dad asked me to help him outside.
So I went and helped him with the new lawn mower he bought for the rest of the afternoon.
We did take a pause in the middle to eat lunch/dinner though.
Shortly after I took a shower was done for the day my mom came back home.
We watched the movie “The Believer” (2201) together.
During the movie I was going to eat a bowl of cereal, but there was none left.
So I made a bowl of oatmeal instead.
Once the movie was over I got ready for bed and then stayed up for a while longer.
