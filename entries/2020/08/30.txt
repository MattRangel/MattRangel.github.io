August 30, 2020 - Sunday
I didnâ€™t have my alarm set this morning, but I still woke up at pretty much the same time.
First my dad woke me up and asked to borrow some money.
I was able to fall back asleep after that.
A little while later my mom woke me up delivering a message from my dad.
He wanted me to go and turn off something outside in the shed.
I fell asleep a little, but not all the way and ended up getting on my phone.
After a bit I got out of bed a brushed my teeth.
Then I ate leftover beans with corn and rice from yesterday for breakfast.
I hung out in my room until it got to be around lunch time.
I helped my dad with that then ate and went back to hanging out.
At some point later I ate the rest of my cotton candy icecream from yesterday and also a pack of fruit snacks.
Later in the night I had leftovers from lunch which was a bowl of noodles and some chicken.
After that I got the dishes all done.
Later on my dad started spraying the house with poison, so I had to move my things away from the wall to the middle of my room.
I brushed my teeth and then cleaned my room which took longer than normal, because I had to put all my things back.
After that I stayed awake for a bit more before going to bed.
