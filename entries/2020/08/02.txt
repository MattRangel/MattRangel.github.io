August 2, 2020 - Sunday
￼After eating breakfast this morning I practiced my reading in Spanish.
Then I played on my computer for a little bit.
My dad called my brother and I to come help him outside at some point.
So the rest of my afternoon I was out with him helping clean the shed.
For dinner I had left over stew and my dad made noodles.
After dinner I washed then dishes.
Then my mom, dad, and I watched the movie “Escape from Pretoria” (2020).
After the movie I went to my room and procrastinated getting ready for bed.
I finally did and then went to bed pretty late again.
