August 22, 2020 - Saturday
I had to wait for my brother to finish in the bathroom before going to brush my teeth.
After that I ate some cookies that my cousin Dagan made.
Then I went back downstairs and hung out for a while.
Eventually it was time to go drive with Dagan, my brother, and my other cousin David.
We were all going to help David move into his college dorm (the parents drove in a seperate car).
I played music for the car ride and once we got to the college we took some photos.
Then I waited in the car with my brither and Dagan while they all did their thing.
After that we all went to Mexican resturant where some more people met us.
David said good bye and left and then Dagan, my brother, the parents, and I all went to Dairy Queen to get ice cream.
I was going to get a misty float, but accidentally got a misty slush (same thing but no ice cream) instead and didn’t realize until I got it.
On the drive back home my phone was low battery so I just listened to music and ended up falling asleep.
I layed down for a while then got up to eat some cereal.
After that I got my teeth brushed and then layes back down again.
I was just hanging out on my phone and then Dagan and my brother put on the movie “All Dogs Go to Heaven” (1989).
I only half watched the movie while I did things on my phone.
One of the things I was doing was looking at putting my Apple Music library onto Spotify, because I found out that Spotify does sell a yearly subscription for the same price as Apple Music.
I’m thinking to switch, because more people I know use Spotify and also it has better recommendations.
Once the movie was over I stayed up for a little bit more.
Then I changed into pajamas and went to bed kind of late.
Better than yesterday again, but still not very good considering I’m going to have to drive tomorrow.
