August 6, 2020 - Thursday
I woke up late this morning, but still had a little free time before I had to go to my grandparents’ house.
I used that time (and most of my other time today) working on a new project.
It is a webapp that does the same thing as the python program that I was working on a few weeks ago.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house I ate lunch and then worked on my project some more.
Took a break to eat some fruit and then got right back to work until it was time to eat dinner.
After eatting dinner I headed home.
I was going to watch the matrix movie with my mom, but she was too tired.
So I spent some more time working on my project.
I ended up staying up working on it pretty late.
But I actually pretty much finished it all in a day which is very cool to me.
All that’s left to do is just some small tweaks that I might not even bother with.
While I was getting ready for bed my dad asked me if I would want to work with him at one of his bank jobs.
I agreed to that, and now I’ll be waking up bright and early tomorrow.
