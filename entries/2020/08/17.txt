August 17, 2020 - Monday
I woke up late this morning so all I had time to do before leaving to my grandparents’ house was get ready for the day and take out the trash.
As I was heading over there I had to turn around and go back home, because I forgot to throw away some meat trash from the freezer.
Once I got to my grandparents’ I ate lunch.
Next I worked on making a computer program for a while.
After I finished it I watched the movie “Doctor Dolittle” (1998) with my grandparents.
Following the movie I just hung out for a bit.
I was full from eating snacks, so all I had for dinner was soup and a sandwich.
Once I got home I did the dishes and then got ready for bed.
Didn’t go to bed until way later though.
