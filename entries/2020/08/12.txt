August 12, 2020 - Wednesday
First thing I did after getting ready for the day was practice some more of my spanish reading.
After that I ate some breakfast and watched youtube.
I hung out and watched youtube plus chatted with friends for pretty much all the way until the afternoon.
My mom got back from the gym and I watched a movie called “The Hater” (2020) with her.
Following that I hung out some more.
Then once I got the energy to get up I went and washed the dishes then got ready for bed.
I stayed up for a while more, but I ended up going to bed at a much better time than yesterday.
