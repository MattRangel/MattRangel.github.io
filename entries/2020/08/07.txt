August 7, 2020 - Friday
I woke up super early this morning from my alarm that I set last night.
I woke up so early because I was going with my dad to Austin to help him with a job.
I did the drive to Austin.
The job was installing electrical stuff inside a bank inside an H.E.B.
We worked for pretty much the whole entire day.
Taking a break to eat here and there.
Some of the things I ate were a sausage+cheese+bread thing, sushi, and BBQ.
After we were finally done we made a stop at a specialty supermarket.
On our way home we stopped at my grandparents’ house to give them a few things my dad bought.
Following that we made one last stop to get ice cream before heading home.
Once I got home I wasn’t immediately￼ so I stayed up for a while more until I got really tired.
