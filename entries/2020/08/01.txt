August 1, 2020 - Saturday
For breakfast I had some leftover pizza and crab rangoons.
I hung out in my room on my phone watching TV and other stuff for most the day.
My dad made stew for lunch and I made the rice.
After that I worker some on my defensive driving class on the computer.
In the afternoon I watched the movie “Jungle” (2017) with my mom and dad.
I ate a bunch of snacks during the movie.
After the movie I went to my room and procrastinated getting ready bed for a really long time.
I finally did after I started to get super tired.
