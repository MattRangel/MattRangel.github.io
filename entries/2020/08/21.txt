August 21, 2020 - Friday
Today was mostly just me hanging out on my phone.
For breakfast I had some of the rice and beans my dad was making for lunch.
Lunch was the rice and beans plus fries, chicken, and pork.
After lunch I went back downstairs.
I played a little hackysack with my cousin Dagan and also an addition game on the computer for a little while.
When Dagan and my brother went to go play Pokémon Go I stayed back and didn’t go.
I ate a few bowls of cereal and came back downstairs.
Scrolled through my phone and chatted with friends for a while more.
Once it got late I got my teeth brushed and took a shower.
I stayed up for a little bit after that before going to bed.
Went to bed at a not so great time again, but still better than yesterday.
