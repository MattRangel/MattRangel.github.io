August 26, 2020 - Wednesday
This morning I went on a walk with my mom.
For breakfast I had a can of Spaghetti-Os.
I hung ount for the rest of the morning.
Later in the afternoon I watched the movie “Brubaker” (1980) with my mom.
We stopped in the middle of it to eat the lunch my dad made.
After the movie I went back to hanging out.
I was just starting a phone call with my friend Sherry to play Minecraft with her when my brother asked me if I wanted to come get pizza for dinner.
So I got off the phone and went to the car.
No one wanted to drive at first, but I ended up being the one to.
Once I got back home I ate my slice of pizza and then called back Sherry to play Minecraft with her.
After she had to get off I just chilled some more.
Eventually I got up and did the dishes then brushed my teeth.
Following that I stayed up for a good while more before finally going to bed.
