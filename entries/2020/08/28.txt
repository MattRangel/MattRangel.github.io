August 28, 2020 - Friday
My dad woke me up early this morning to start working on fixing the car.
It turned out that the belt breaking broke another part, so we had to go and buy that.
We didn’t finished it all up until the afternoon.
I took a shower and then ate leftovers and a banana for lunch.
After lunch I went to my room and played on my computer for a bit.
Next I went out with my mon and dad to get thr car tires rotated and also an oil change.
Before those we stopped at a car wash and my dad cleaned some grease off from behind the tires.
Once we were all done with car stuff we went to a restaurant called “BJ’s”.
I got some pasta then ate an ice cream sugar cookie with my mom and dad for dessert.
Once I got back home I put on a movie called “Sicario” (2015).
After that movie I watched part two which was called “Sicario: Day of the Soldado” (2018).
Next movie I watched was “Hell or High Water” (2016).
Following that marathon of movies I finished getting ready for bed.
I stayed up for a little bit long then went to sleep.
