This morning I started a two month free trial of Spotify.
I’m going to compare it to Apple Music during that time and then decided which one I want once it comes time for me to renew Apple Music or not in October.
On my drive to my grandparents’ house the car started making a weird noise, so I pulled over to check it out.
It turned out that one of the belts was messed up.
So I headed back home and switched cars to the truck.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house I ate lunch and then went to work on my Spotify some more.
I wanted to watch a movie with my grandparents, but I forgot my computer charger at home and I also had no movie ideas anyways.
Later my dad called me asking me to pick up a new belt for the car.
He already set up the order over the phone, so all I had to do was tell them hos name and then pay.
After that I stopped and got some pizza for dinner.
Then I filled up the truck’s gas tank and headed back to my grandparents’ house.
After I got back I water the grass.
Once the grass watering process was done I ate some fruit and then took a shower.
Next I ate my dinner and then headed home.
At home I just went to my room and then used Spotify’s music listening party feature to listen to music with friends for a while.
After I was done listening to music I got up and brushed my teeth.
I stayed up for a little bit after that and then went to bed.
