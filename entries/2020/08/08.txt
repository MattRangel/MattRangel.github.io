August 8, 2020 - Saturday
After waking up this morningI went to the store with all my faimly to get some things to make banana ice cream and other stuff.
Once we got back home I watched the movie “The Matrix” (1999) with my mom.
Following that I worked on some more of my defensive driving class.
Then I just hung out for a while.
After my mom got back home from driving around with my brother I watched “The Matrix Reloaded” (2003) with my mom.
I made the banama ice cream with my dad afterwards and then brushed my teeth.
I stayed up for a long time afterwards procrastinating writing up this.
