November 24, 2020 - Tuesday
Once I woke up I layed in bed for a little bit on my phone catching up on things before getting up.
After I got my teeth brushed I collected up my things to get ready to go to my grandparents’ house.
Before leaving I ate three fourths of the last cook from the batch my brother cooked on Sunday.
Then my brother abd I headed out.
Once we got there it wasn’t quite lunch time, so I hung out on my phone until it was.
For lunch my grandma made soup, steak, rice, and beans.
Afterwards I got on my computer and played Minecraft with my friend Sherry for a good while.
Once I got off I ate some grapes and an apple along with some juice.
Then I just hung out on my phone not doing too much besides chatting with friends and scrolling through social media until it was time for dinner.
I took a shower and then ate the pizza from yesterday which my grandma reheated.
Following dinner my brother and I headed back home.
Getting home I went to my room and then just plopped in my bed.
Staying in my bed for a while until it started to get late I just chatted with friends and scrolled through my phone some more.
Once I got up I did the dishes and then brushed my teeth.
After I was ready for bed I wrote up this entry and then went to sleep.
My bedtime for today wasn’t the greatest, but like I’ve said the past few days I don’t really have to wake up early so I’ve still been getting all my sleep.
