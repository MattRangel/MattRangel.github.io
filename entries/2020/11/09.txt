November 9, 2020 - Monday
There was no school today for Veteran’s Day, so I was able to sleep in and make up for going to bed so late last night.
Once I woke up I got my teeth brushed and my face washed.
Then I caught up on some groupchats that my friends have.
After hanging out for a bit I started getting ready to go over to my grandparents’ house.
Once I got over there I threw away the trash I brought from home and brought my things inside.
For lunch my grandma made asparagus, rice, shrimp, and sweet mashed potatoes￼.
After lunch I didn’t really do too much for a while and just scrolled through my phone.
Later on I got on my computer and played some Minecraft with my brother.
Shortly after I was done playing I prepared some cinnamon rolls with my grandma to have with dinner.
Then I took a shower and hung out out for a bit more until dinner was ready.
Dinner was shrip, rice, garlic bread, and of course cinnamon rolls.
Before I left to go back home my dad called me asking to stop at a gas station on my way home.
When I got there it turned out that his car was breaking down, so he needed a ride home tonight and he will get it towed to the mechanic tomorrow.
Once I got home I went to my room.
The plan was only to stay on my phone for a bit, ￼but I ended up getting distracted.
Once I got back on task and washed the dishes then brushed my teeth it was a bit later than I was shootinf for.
Still better than some of the times I was going to bed last week though which is good.
