November 30, 2020 - Monday
I woke up a bit too early this morning since I couldn’t remeber what time I usually wake up for school when I was setting my alarm last night.
My school day was quick and easy besides me having to take a break while I wait for one of my teachers to upload the work for the day.
For lunch I had lasagna and sweet mashed potatoes.
After school I spent a good amount of time messing with an application called Kodi on my computer.
I ended up only being able to figure out part of what I was trying to do.
Following that I watched some TV on my phone and then took a shower and ate dinner.
I had the same thing for dinner as I did for lunch.
Following dinner I read part of my book and then went home.
I had a bit of time before I planned to go to bed, but I ended up spending most of it distracted on my phone.
Once I got up to do the dishes I was only half way through when my dad realized our house’s septic tank was clogged.
Changing into some warmer clothes I went outside to help shine a light for my dad while he used a metal snake thing to unclog the pipes.
After we were done I cleaned my gloves and hands then went back to washing the dishes.
Next I brushed my teeth which also took quite a bit due to me getting distracted on my phone again.
Once I came back to my room I put off writing this for a very long time which put me going to bed pretty late.
