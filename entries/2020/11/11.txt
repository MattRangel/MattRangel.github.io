November 11, 2020 - Wednesday
My school day was a bit long today, because I spent a bit of time working ahead so I’d have less work to do on Friday.
Another thing that made my school day take longer was that I had to code some things for my computer class.
It wasn’t anything teribly difficult.
It just took a long time, because I got side tracked trying to do something additional for fun.
After school I just hung out on my phone chatting with friends and scrolling through stuff.
I was going to watched something like a TV show or movie, but I never ended up getting the energy to.
Later in the afternoon I made an icecream shake which was my grandma’s idea.
It was a pretty soft though since the ice cream was already no fully hard, because their freezer doesn’t get super cold.
Once it got to be night time I took a shower and used my scalp brush again for the second day in a row.
It’s still too early to tell if it’s doing anything, but it kind seems like it’s helping.
After dinner before leaving to go back home I sat down to read some more of my book “The Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follet”.
After finishing the prologue of the book I think I’m going to enjoy it.
Once I got home I hung out for a while before getting started on my nightly tasks.
I did half of my nightly routine, the dishes, and then the other half of my routine.
My going to bed time wasn’t the best, and it’s because I spent too long just hanging out after I got home.
