My schoolday took a while, but I did good and not getting distracted otherwise it would’ve taken much longer.
The work for my graphic design class took a long time, because I had to download a different program than what the teacher had instructions for and firgure out how to do the assignment on my own.
After school I was pretty tired so I didn’t really do too much besides watch stuff on my phone.
Later in the afternoon I got a text from my friend Ben invited my other friend Darious and I to go to an axe throwing place with him this weekend.
I told him I’d ask my parents once I got home.
After I took a shower and ate dinner I stayed at my grandparents’ house a while more before going home again.
I read some more of my book “The Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett” and actually finished the first chapter.
Or the first part of the first chapter, I’m not really sure how the book is organized yet.
Reading more of it I am definitely liking it so far and I’m not having too much difficulty￼ understanding it.
On my way back home I had to stop and get some gas.
Once I got home I did not follow my plan of fully getting ready for bed before laying down.
Instead I had to get up to do my nightly routine later on.
If I would have written this up then went to bed right after I would’ve been fine, but instead I stayed up later not writting this entry.
