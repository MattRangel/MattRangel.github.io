On the drive to school this morning I let my brother play the music.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house I finished all my school work for the day pretty quickly.
After that I was going to start a TV show to catch up with my mom, but I was too tired to feel like watching it.
I took a nap in the afternoon and woke up to some sales persom knocking on the door.
For dinner I had the same thing as lumch which was chicken alfredo pasta and some soup.
Once I got home my dad called me outside to show him that he got the ATV he’s been working on to run.
So he gave me a ride and then I came back inside to watch a movie with my mom.
We also tried some sugar cookie M&M’s which weren’t the best.
The movie I put on was called “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” (2000).
I really liked the movie.
Afterwards I got my teeth brushed.
What I should’ve done next was write this up then go to sleep.
Instead though I stayed up late again.
