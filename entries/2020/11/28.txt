November 28, 2020 - Saturday
My morning was started by me waking up to my dad asking if I wanted some brunch.
Hungry having just woken up I said yes and got started on brushing my teeth.
After I finished my morning routine I ate the egg in pretzel sandwich that my dad prepared for me.
Then I went to my room and just hung out for a bit until my mom got home.
We chatted for a little while and then I went with her to the kitchen while she made a pumpkin smoothie.
While she ate her finished smoothie I ate some of the ice cream my parents bought me yesterday.
After that my mom and I went outside to go on a walk, but came back inside since it was starting to sprinkle and my mom’s ankle was sore.
We watched the movie “Full Metal Jacket” (1987).
During the start of the movie I reheated some thanksgiving leftovers for my lunch.
Next I finished the rest of my ice cream.
Following the movie I went back to my room, but not for long becausemy dad wanted me to pull up a documentary on the television for him called “Expedición Tribugá” (2020).
Once I got it on TV I ended up staying to watch it too.
After that I put on a TV show for my dad which he asked me for then I went back to my hanging out in my room.
I came out of my room to eat some Rice Krispies.
While I did that I also watched a TV show called “Neon Genesis Evangelion” (1995-1996).
Then I got ready for bed and went back to my room.
I finished watching the episode I was on, then I read for a bit, and then I watched some more TV before going to sleep.
My bedtime for tonight was perfect and that’s because I made sure not to do all my things right up until I was ready to go to bed.
