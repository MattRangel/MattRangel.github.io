November 10, 2020 - Tuesday
Starting off my dad today my school day was short and pretty average.
After school I took my grandpa to get his car inspected so he coukd renew the registration.
The inspection was very quick and all I had to do was flick on and off the lights and pop the hood of the car.
Once I got back to my grandparents’ house I ate a couple strawberries and some ice cream.
Then I bought a game on my computer to be able to play with somr friends.
It took too long to download, so I didn’t end up playing today though.
My dad stopped by and gave me some packages that I got in the mail.
The first thing was my new ID since my old one expired.
The other package was a leather case for my airpods.
I put the case on and I’m very happy with it and how it looks.
The color also matches my wallet which is cool.
I was able to try out the scalp brush I got in the mail the other day when I took my shower.
Rubbing my head later on it was still dry, but hopefully it’ll start to work after using it a few more times.
If it doesn’t end up working it’s not a huge loss though since it was only a couple dollars.
Once I got back home after eating dinner I chatted on my phone and filled up my new pen I got in the mail yesterday.
The glow in the dark ink I got to go with it looks very good and is basically invisible looking at it without a UV light.
After that I put some leather cream stuff that came with my airpods case on the case.
There was a bunch left over so I put some on my wallet and some of my dad’s things.
Following that I went back to my room where I spent a bit too long before getting up to do my duties.
Waiting so long really messed me up for today.
The plan for tomorrow is that I’m going to do my nightly things more right away instead of saving them for last.
