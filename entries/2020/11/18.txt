November 18, 2020 - Wednesday
After dropping my brother off at school I went to my grandparents’ house for another full day of working.
First I had to make a few essays I wrote yesterday longer to meet a word requirement.
Then I went on to work on finishing a project for my graphic design class.
That project took quite a while since I was being perfectionist.
All the work I’ve been putting in the past few day will pay off the last two day of the school week wjen I have little to no work left to do.
After I finished working for today I had a tiny bit of time to just chill before I took a shower and ate dinner.
Following my shower and dinner I went back to the room I stay in and read another chapter of “Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Folett”.
Once I got back home my parents were talking with my brother about family stuff.
I got ready for bed and then washed the dishes.
Next I had some time before bed so I texted with friends and then went to sleep a tiny bit late.
I’m doing really good at going to bed on time this week, and I’m hoping to continue the trend through thanksgiving break next week.
