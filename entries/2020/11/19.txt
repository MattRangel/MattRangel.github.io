November 19, 2020 - Thursday
My school day today was very brief.
All that I had to to were a couple short things and then I was done for the day.
Today was a movies day for me which feels good to get back into again instead of just scrolling through my phone all day.
The first movie I watched I had already started a few days ago and is called “Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring” (2003).
Right after that movie I started another movie called “The Best of Youth” (2003).
I watched that movie all the way up until I finished eatting dinner (it’s a very long movie lol) and I still wasn’t done with it.
After dinner I read another part of my book “Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett”.
It turns out what I’ve been calling “chapters” of the book the past few days were just parts of one chapter.
I read a bit more than usual, because the first part I finished was short so I went on to read another part which was pretty long.
Once I got home I right away got started on getting ready for bed.
After I finished that I came outside to cut my nails (that’s where I am right now writing this!).
Following that I had a little bit of time before going to sleep, so I hung out on my phone for that little bit of time.
Today was another good going to sleep on time day.
I’m getting used to putting myself to bed on time again which is great.
