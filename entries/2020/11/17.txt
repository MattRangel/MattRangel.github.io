November 17, 2020 - Tuesday
My school day at my grandparents’ house today was pretty much the same as yesterday.
I spent the whole day up until dinner working on schoolk work.
Unlike yesterday though today I was working ahead, because my family was planning to drive to Iowan and I was going to miss school on friday.
Once it got to be time for dinner I took a shower and then ate.
My grandma made empanadas for dinner today.
After dinner I read another chapter of my book “The Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follet”.
On my drive home it was too cold to drive with the windows down.
During my drive I got a call from my mom who was wondering where I was.
I explained I was working late which had me leaving late.
She also told me that my dad and her decided to not go to Iowa, because there was a Covid surge in Iowa.
Once I got home I got started on the dishes and got ready for bed.
Following that I had a little bit of time before I had to go to bed so I chatted with friends for bit.
I went to bed at at the right time tonight which is good.
