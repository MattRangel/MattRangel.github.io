November 2, 2020 - Monday
My schoolday was a bit long today, but that’s because I worked ahead in one of my classes and finished all the work for the week.
After school I layed down and hung out on my phone.
I ended up starting the album “Everywhere at the end of time” by “The Caretaker”.
It’s six hours long though, so I didn’t listen to all of it today.
The album is split into stages and each of them are about the stages of Alzheimer's.
Once I got back home from my grandparents’ house I got my teeth brushed then washed the dishes.
After that I could’ve written this up then went to bed at a good time, but I ended up staying up late again.
A better time than last night though, so I’ll still call it progress haha.
