November 25, 2020 - Wednesday
I slept in late this morning and woke up to phone calls from each of my parents.
After I called both of them back up I got my teeth brushed.
My dad got home and I helped him carry in a couple things he got from the store.
Then he got started on what we would all eat for dinner.
I helped him a little bit and also put some of the gumbo from the other day on the stove to have for lunch.
My dad had to leave to go pick up a powerwasher he found a good deal on, so I watched the pressure cooker and took it off the heat when it was time.
After that my dad had told me to tell my brother to make a pot of rice.
Before the rice finished cooking my mom and brother had to leave to go to church.
So I watched the rice and took that off the heat when it was time too.
Then I just hung out for a bit until my dad got back home.
Once he did I ate a croissant he had bought and moved his truck to the shed.
I worked outside with for the rest of the afternoon reinstalling the cargo box onto his ATV.
Once we were finally finished he let me drive my brother around the house a few times.
Then we came back inside to eat dinner.
Dinner was steak, rice, refried beans, avacado, tomato, and some ripped up tortilla all in a bowl.
My brother and dad ate it like a taco instead of mixing it all together.
Following dinner I rest my mom’s computer, because all the files and apps she had were slowing it down a ton.
After that I watched the movie “Snowden” (2016) with my mom.
We took a pause so my mom could join a virtual meeting with her friends.
While she did that I washed the dishes and then got read for bed.
Once we were both done my mom’s computer had finished resetting so I set it up and reinstalled her applications for her.
Then we resumed the movie.
Next I washed my face and then stayed up for a little bit more before going to bed.
I didn’t check the exact time I went to bed last night, but today was definitely￼ better.
