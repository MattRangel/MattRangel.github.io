November 26, 2020 - Thursday
Today was thanksgiving.
For the morning I just hung out until it was time to start getting ready to go to my grandparents’ house.
Before getting in the car and going my mom took a photo of my dad, brother, and I all in the ATV.
Then my dad and I put the thanksgiving food he cooked in the truck and then headed out.
My mom drove a seperate car with my brother, because she was going to have to leave earlier than us to go hone and finish her work day.
Once we all got to my grandparents’ house we waited for the food to fibish up and then we ate.
My dad cooked turkey, pork, stuffing, and gravy.
My grandma cooked rice, black beans and yucca.
After I ate the lunch I had a slice of apple pie.
Then I sat on the couch for a bit until everyone finished eating.
Then we all took a group photo together.
Following that my grandma, dad, mom, brother, and I all played a card game for a little bit.
After my mom left to go home and work I went and layed on the bed.
I didn’t really do too much and just hung out until later in the afternoon.
My grandma made my brother and I sandwhiches for dinner.
She also gave me a cookie and some cheese.
After that we all went back home.
Once we got home my dad took my brother and I on an ATV ride onto our country road.
Getting back I went to my room and just chilled until my brother told me he made some cinnamon rolls.
I ate a couple of thoes and then started getting ready for.
Since I waited so long to start getting ready for bed I ended up staying up a bit too late tonight.
