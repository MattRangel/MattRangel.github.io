November 3, 2020 - Tuesday
I woke up tired this morning.
Brought a new book to my grandparents’ house to read for school, because I got sick of the old one I was reading.
My school day was short today.
After school I put on some music and rested for a while.
Then I looked for a movie to watch with my grandparents.
Eventually I chose the movie “Liar Liar” (1997).
Following that I went and hung out on my phone for a while more until I ate dinner.
By the time I finished dinner I had been looking at the results of the upcomming election as the came out.
Once I got hkme I did the dishes then got ready for bed and cut my nails.
After that I stayed up for quite a while more.
I was watching videos and reading things about the election results and ended up going to bed really late.
