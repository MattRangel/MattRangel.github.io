November 6, 2020 - Friday
I woke up tired again this morning.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house I was there a bit early, so I didn’t start school right away.
My school day wasn’t too long, and it could’ve been even faster if I was fully focused.
After school I just watched YouTube and chatted with friends on my phone.
I also helped change the tube lightbulbs in the kitchen for my grandparents.
On my way back home I realized I forgot to grab some rosemary from a bush for my dad, but I was already half way home by that time.
Once I did get home I saw that no one had gotten the mail which included a package that I was expecting.
So my mom and I walked down to the mailbox and back to get the mail.
The package I got was the battery for my grandparents’ phone.
The plan is to go there tomorrow morning to get the rosemary and install their new battery.
After our walk my mom and I looked for a movie to watched and ended up choosing one called “Black Box” (2020).
After the movie I got ready for bed nice and quick.
Following that is where I messed up and stayed up too late.
