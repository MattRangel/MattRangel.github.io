November 8, 2020 - Sunday
When I woke up this morning I could hear that my dad was cooking something.
So I decided to wait to eat until he was finished.
I just hung out in my room texting with friends.
Later on I ended up going outside to work woth my dad.
The task for today was planting fruit plants into the ground.
It took all the way to the night time, but we did take a break at one point to eat lunch.
The fruits that we planted were lime, blueberry, peach, and fig.
After it got too dark to plant anything more we washed a few pieces of the ATV and then cleaned up a bit.
Once we got back inside I watched a movie with my dad called “Body of Lies” (2008).
During the movie I ate quite a bit.
First was the last slice of apple pie that my dad bought, next was an arepa that my dad cooked, thirdly was some bummy bears, and lastly was a bowl of cereal.
After the movie was over I still had to get rwady for bed and wash the dishes.
I didn’t do the things I needed to right away though.
So I ended up going to sleep super late by the time I actually finished everything.
At least I don’t have to wake up super early for school tomorrow, but it is going to make getting back on track more difficult.
