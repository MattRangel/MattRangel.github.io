November 7, 2020 - Saturday
I woke up to my alarm this morning, because I bad to go to my grandparents’ house and didn’t want to sleep in too late.
The reason I had to go over there was to put a new battery in there phone and also snip some rosemary for my dad to cook with.
After doing my two missions my grandparents asked me to stay and eat breakfast with them.
So I ate the breakfast my grandparents and then I talked with my grandma for a little while.
Once I got back home I had only been hanging out for a little while when my dad called for me.
He needed to help him outside on the ATV.
The work wasn’t too hard we were just out there for a long time.
After we stopped working on the ATV we worked on preparing to plant some blueberry bushes.
Throughout working with my dad we left and came back twice.
First time was to the auto parts store and the second time was to Home Depot to get stuff for the blueberries.
By the time we wrapped up for the day it was dinner time and already night.
For dinner my dad made steak, tuna, potatoes, and a salad.
I helped him a tiny bit here and there.
After I finished eating dinner I ate a slice of the pie my dad bought the other day. 
Following dinner I went to my room to hang out.
My dad asked if anyone wanted to get ice cream and Dairy Queen.
My brother and I said yes and my mom came along for the ride.
I chose a chocolate dipped vanilla cone.
Once I got home I put off brushing my teeth for a while.
After I finally did brush my teeth my procrastination just switched to me not writing up today’s entry.
I did go to bed late, but I don’t have anything to wake up abd do tomorrow, so hopefully I’ll be able to get a good rest.
