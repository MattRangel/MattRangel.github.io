November 4, 2020 - Wednesday
I woke pretty tired again this morning again.
I know I’ve said this alrwady haha, but I’m going to start trying to go to bed on time.
During the middle of my school day I went to the store to buy some tortillas for my grandma to make lunch.
Once I got back I ate lunch and then finished up my work day.
After my school day I just hung out like I normally do.
One dofferent thing though is that I started reading a new book that I bought a really long time ago but never got around to.
The book is called “Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett”.
I’ve only read the introduction chapter, so I’m not sure how much I’m going to like it yet.
As it was getting about time for me to eat dinner my dad texted me asking me to grab something from the autoshop.
So I headed over there real quick then came back to my grandparents’ house and ate dinner.
Once I got back home I watched a movie called “Instant Family” (2018).
After the movie I washed the dishes the got ready for bed.
Tonight I did good at not wasting too much time in-between each thing.
I went to bed late still, but just much better than yesterday.
