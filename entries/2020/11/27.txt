November 27, 2020 - Friday
After getting out of bed this morning and brushing my teeth I got ready to go out.
Then I went over to my grandparents’ house for lunch.
My grandma prepared leftovers from thanksgiving for my meal.
Following that I read for a little bit before leaving.
I went over to my friend Darious’ house to pick him up and bring him to my other friend Ben’s house.
Once we got there we went outside and played with the axe throwing area he just got set up recently.
We also shot a bow and tried throwing knifes.
After we came back inside we played video games for a bit until it started to get dark.
Then I drove us all to the Dollar General to get candy.
We got only easy to chew candy, becauss last time that ward candy got annoying.
Getting back to Ben’s house I got started on making some popcorn while Darious combined and split up all the candy equally.
The movie we watched was “The Hunger Games” (2012).
We all had already seen it, but it had been a while.
After the movie we watched YouTube for a bit on Ben’s computer.
Then I brought Darious back to hise house and then I headed back home.
Once I got home I was messing with my brother looking and movies on his computer.
I ended up putting on the short movie “Eternal Family” (1997).
It was a strange movie, but I was able to understand it and did enjoy it.
After that I got ready for bed and did a few things on my phone before going to sleep.
These past few days I haven’t done too well at going to bed on time, but that’s going to have to change very soon once school starts again.
