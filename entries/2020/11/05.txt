November 5, 2020 - Thursday
Today wasn’t too interesting of a day.
I didn’t have too much work to do for school.
After school I was going to watch a movie and so I tried to download it, but it messed up and I didn’t feel like it anymore by that point.
So most of my dad was watching YouTube videos and messaging with friends.
I looked at the election statistics some, but not as much as yesterday because I could tell nothing was really going to be decided today.
Once I got home I got ready for bed and then just hung out until it was time for me to go to sleep.
It was nice to actually go to bed at a good time again and hopefully I’ll continue that.
