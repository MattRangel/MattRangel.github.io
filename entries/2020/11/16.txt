November 16, 2020 - Monday
My schoolday was very long.
I was working all the way up until it was time for dinner.
The first thing that took a while was a test in english class over a play we’ve been reading.
Then I spent another chunk of time on work for my business class.
Lasly I did an assignment for my graphic design class which also took quite a while since I was being perfectionist.
After I finally finished working I took a shower and then ate dinner.
Before going back home I read another chapter of my book “Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follet”.
I can for sure tell now that I like the book.
Once I got home I went to my room to empty my pockets.
I ended up sitting down for a bit and texting with friends which ended up making me go to bed a bit late.
Then I got ready for bed and washed the dishes.
After that I came back to my room to write up this entry and then I went to sleep.
I went to bed a little bit later that I was trying for, but I’d still call it a sucess.
