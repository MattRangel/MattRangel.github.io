November 23, 2020 - Monday
There is no school this week because it’s now thanksgiving break.
After waking up this morning I got my teeth brusged then collected up all the trash in the house.
I put the trash and my computer in my car then came back inside to eat one of the cookies my brother made yesterday.
Then I cleaned some bowls that belonged to my grandma to bring them back to her house.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house I threw away the trash then cane inside.
There was still some time before lunch, so I just hung out a bit on my phone.
Following lunch I started a new TV show which a new friend of mine had said she liked.
My sister Alexa called me and we talked for a little bit.
For a snack I had some pineapple and also a cookie which my grandma made the other day.
Later in the afternoon my grandparents gave me some money to go to Pizza Hut and buy dinner.
The Pizza Hut had a drive through which made it nice and easy.
I ordered a half hawaiian half pepperoni pizza and some breadsticks.
While I waited I just listened to music and went on my phone.
I brought my book “Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett” to read it, but I only ended up reading a page or two.
After I got back with the food I took a shower and then ate.
Following dinner I read some more for a bit and then headed home.
Once I got home I played game of Uno with my mom and brother.
Next I got ready for bed and washed the dishes.
I didn’t really do too much for the rest of the night and just hung out in my room.
The time I went to bed today was a bit late, but again I am not going to be waking up early for anything.
