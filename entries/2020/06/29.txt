June 29, 2020 - Monday
This morning I slept in a little later than I normally do.
Once I was up I got my teeth brushed and then ate some of the Hi-Chew candies my parents bought me last night.
Then I collected up the trash to take to my grandparents’ house.
I spent the rest of my time at home just hanging out.
At my grandparents’ house I ate hawaiian pizza for lunch.
Then I layed down at watched videos on my phone for a while.
My friend Elijah called me while I was doing that so I sat up and talked with him.
We talked for a while and then he had to get off to go somewhere.
I then played some minecraft again with some other friends (Kody and Gena).
After we all got off from that I went back to hanging out on my phone.
Then Gena invited me to call with her and a new friend of mine Mike.
We all talked for a while until I had to go eat dinner.
For dinner I had hawaiian pizza, a hotdog, and tomato soup.
On my drive home I listened to an artist called “Sematary” recommended to me by Elijah.
First thing I did when I got home was I got my teeth brushed.
Then I hopped on my computer and played a few internet browser games, but not for too long I was just messing around.
Afterwards I hung out for a while more until my parents got back home.
I was getting the energy to get out of bed and wash the dishes when my dad called for me.
I thought he was going to ask me to help him with something, but I was happily surprised￼ when it was instead to give me $10 for my portion of the money he got for scrapping the metal poles I helped him pick up from the yard yesterday.
After that I did do the dishes while watching a YouTube video.
Once I was done with the dishes I went back to my room and wrote up this entry you are reading.
Then before going to bed I finished watching (more so listening because it was a spoken story) the YouTube video I started earlier.
