June 28, 2020 - Sunday
After waking up this morning I ate a can of SpaghettiOs and a banana for breakfast.
Then I went to my room and played on my computer for a while.
My dad cooked some eggs to go with leftover rice at around noon.
I went back to my room to hang out some more until it was time for me to leave.
I went to go hang out with my friends Ben and Darious.
Today I went to Darious’ house first to pick him up and tale him to Ben’s.
At Ben’s house we swam for a while and the ate burgers that his dad made.
After eating we all headed over to Darious’ house.
Over there we played pool and darts.
Once we were all tired and done hanging out I went with Ben back to his house where my car was.
I then drove back home.
At home my family was just starting a movie.
They had also went out and bought movie snacks.
They thought of me and bought some Hi-Chews which was really nice.
I didn’t watch the movie and instead ate a few candies then washed the dishes.
Then I got my teeth brushed and my room cleaned.
Went to bed after that about an hour later than I would’ve liked to.
