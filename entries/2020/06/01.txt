June 1, 2020 - Monday
This morning I didn’t do too much and then I continued my not doing too much this afternoon at my grandparents’ house.
All I really did was watch some YouTube videos and scroll through my phone.
There are lots of protest and riot videos online so it’s easy to get sucked into going through them for a long time.
A little while after I got home tonight I did the dishes.
While I was doing them I started the movie “The Count of Monte Cristo” (2002).
I didn’t finish the movie so I’m going to probably do that once I wake up tomorrow.
After dishes I got ready for bed abd joined my mom in the middle of her walk.
Once I got back inside the plan was to wash my face, write this up, and then go to bed.
I messed up that plan by getting distracted for a little while after washing my face.
After I got back on track and finished up this entry I went to bed a little under and hour past what I would’ve liked.
