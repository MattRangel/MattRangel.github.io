May 6, 2020 - Saturday
For my breakfast I ate rice, oatmeal, yogurt, and some cereal.
While I ate and a little bit after I finished I watched the movie “Pan’s Labyrinth” (2006).
A little while after the movie my dad called me outside to help him clean the Shed.
I ended up helping him with that for pretty much the rest of the day.
Taking a break in the middle to eat lunch, which was pork, rice, and vegetables.
For dinner my dad and I got sandwiches for us and also my mom and brother.
After getting home and eating my sandwich I talked on the phone with my friend Sarah for a while.
Once she had to get off I got my terth brushed.
Then we listened to some music together before I finally went to bed.
