I almost went to sleep tonight without writing this up!
After I woke up I ate the rest of my cotton candy ice cream.
Then I got the dishes done and went back to my room.
For the rest of my time at home I watched youtube videos and read things about an electronic project I have been thinking of.
Once I got over to my grandparents’ house I ate and then went back to watching youtube videos.
Some of them just normal ones and some over electronic stuff.
My brother abd I ended up eating dinner earlier than we normally do, so that way we could get back home and have time to pack.
Packing for me didn’t take too long at all.
I also got my teeth brushed at this time so that way I could pack away my toothbrush.
After all that I messed around with my radio listening to all the different stations for a bit.
I paused doing that to go and wash the dishes then went back to it afterwards so my phone could charge some more.
Once it was finnaly time to go I got into the passenger seat and put on some music.
I played around on my phone for a little bit before trying to get some rest.
Had to get up from the rest though, because I realized I had forgotten to write this!
My dad started the trip off and I am probably going to continue it at some random hour.
So I want to try and sleep as much as I can.
