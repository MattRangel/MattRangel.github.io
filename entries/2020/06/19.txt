Woke up a little bit later today.
Once I was up I just hung out on my phone and played on the computer mainly.
My breakfast this morning was ramen noodles.
I really wanted to eat cereal, but I already ate a bunch yesterday so I held off on that.
My dad later made an egg sandwich so I ate that as my second breakfast.
I went outside and jumped on the trampoline with my brother and cousin Dagan.
We also shot some basketball and played with the dog.
For dinner there was pizza and some other people came over to celebrate my cousin Davidâ€™s highschool graduation.
There ended up being a few more people than my aunt and uncle expected staying the night.
So when Dagan went to drop off his grandma at her house I followed him in a seperate car so we could bring back some air mattresses.
After I got back I ate a few things more like oreos.
Then I went back to hanging out downstairs until it got late.
I took a shower and brushed my teeth.
I got in bed but stayed up a little bit later texting with my friend Sarah.
Ended up going to bed late again no suprise.
