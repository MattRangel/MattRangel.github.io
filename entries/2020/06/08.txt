June 8, 2020 - Monday
I was more hungry than I normally am this morning, which I think is because I’ve been doing more work than I normally do the past few days.
I still just waited till I went to my grandparents’ house to eat though.
Over there I was going to watch a movie with them, but ended up not because I never found one.
I watched YouTube, went through social media stuff, and also listened to some music during the day over there.
While I was eating dinner I started a movie, but I switched it off so I could watch it with my mom when I got back home.
After I did get back home I put my sticker/decal thing that I got in the mail on to the back of my phone.
Once I finished that I made some popcorn while I waited for my mom to finish talking on the phone.
The movie that I picked out was “Jeremiah Johnson” (1972).
I’m pretty sure I ended up enjoying the movie a bit more than she did lol.
Following the movie I washed the dishes and got ready for bed.
Went to bed a bit late again tonight, but I figured I was would since I planned to watch a movie.
