May 2, 2020 - Tuesday
For the first half of my morning I was just hanging out in my room.
The second half I helped my dad clean the shed until it was time for me to go to my grandparents’ house.
Over there I finished watching the movie “The Count of Monte Cristo” (2002).
Then I started the movie “Magnolia” (1999).
That movie was pretty long, so I didn’t finish it till I got back home.
At home I did the dishes while watching the movie then went to my room to finish it.
After that movie I started another one called “Stranger Than Paradise” (1984).
I didn’t finish that movie tonight, but it did keep me up past the time I try to normally go to bed at.
When I did go to bed it was a little over an hour past the time I shoot for.
