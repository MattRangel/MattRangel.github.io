June 25, 2020 - Thursday
This morning I woke up later than my normal time once again.
After I was up I looked at the ticket papers that I got fron the police officer last night.
I printed out and filled in some paper then headed over to my grandparents’ house.
Over there I ate and watched youtube videos.
I was wanting to find a movie to watch but just never got around to it.
Once I got back home I went to my room and hung out for a while texting with friends.
Ended up procrastinating brushing my teeth for a good while.
After I finally did it was pretty late again.
So tonight is not the start of me going to bed on time.
Today’s entry was very short compared to the other ones, because I didn’t really do too much that had a lot of intricate detail￼.
