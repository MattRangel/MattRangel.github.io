June 14, 2020 - Sunday
I was woke up at my normal time today, but I was pretty tired from going to bed late last night.
When I did get out of bed my dad was just finishing making breakfast.
After I ate breakfast I hung out for the rest of the morning.
My dad called me to come help him outside in the shed.
There were two bikes left that he didn’t fix from yesterday when he was working with my brother.
One of the new bikes we need to buy a new tire for and on the other one we got new tires and tubes on it with only a few hiccups along the way.
After we were done fixing it we loaded it into the back of the truck with the ￼the other bikes.
We came back inside to do a few things and invited my mom and brother to come help test the bikes.
They both ended up coming along to help test them.
After we got a good idea of the state of each bike my mom, brother, and I all chose a bike and went on a ride down the road.
My dad stayed back to do other things in the yard.
The distance we ended up going on the bikes was pretty good.
Any further and I would have been too tired haha.
Once I got back into the house I got the dishes washed.
Then I went back to my room again until my dad made dinner.
For dinner he made some steak that he had been dry aging for a while, rice (my brother made that), yuca, and squash.
After dinner I took my shower.
Then I phone called with my friend Sarah for a little bit.
Once we got off the phone I got the dishes washed.
I spent the next little while hanging out in my room listening to a CD and practicing footbag.
Following that I went on a walk and played frisbee with my mom and brother.
Once I got back inside I just spent the rest of my night chilling.
I ended up going to bed only like twenty minutes past what I was shooting for, which is pretty good.
