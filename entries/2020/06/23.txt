June 23, 2020 - Tuesday
I woke up a little late again this morning, so there wasn’t a whole bunch of time to do things before leaving to my grandparents’ house for the day.
I got up amd ready for the day before getting on my phone which is good, because that was a bad habit I accidentally started a few weeks ago.
After eating lunch at my grandparents’ house I watched a movie.
There haven’t been too many movies I’ve watched lately which I want to get back into.
The movie I watched today was “Mind Game” (2012).
The visuals and animation of the movie were pretty unique and appealing to my eyes.
The story was alright although difficult to follow in a part or two.
Once I finished the movie I spent pretty much the rest of my time over there listening to music.
When I got back home I helped my dad with something, but not for nearly as long as I did yesterday.
Today was a quick help.
Got my teeth brushed after I came back inside and then washed the dishes.
After that I went outside to cut my nails which was a little difficult since it was getting dark outside and was hard to see.
I came back inside and spent the last little bit of my night just listening to music.
Going to bed on time for the first time in around a week which is nice.
