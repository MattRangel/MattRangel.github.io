June 17, 2020 - Wednesday
For context yesterday night my family and I all got in the car to drive to Iowa.
My day started of at around 3:30 am today.
I was woken up by my dad asking me to help drive for a little bit.
I ended up driving all the way till around 8:00 am before switching to my mom.
My mom drove for a couple hours then I finished out the drive.
Some of the road trip foods I ate were an orange, some pizza rolls, one fry, and a burrito.
Once we got to my cousins house I put my things into the room.
Then I went to this Asian restaurant with my dad.
The food we got from there was very eh.
After finishing up eating my food I went back to lounging.
Once dinner time came around my dad invited me to go get something to eat again.
This time we went to the store where I just got a frozen meal.
I ate it up after heating it then hung out on my phone some more.
Once my cousins got back from work I ate cereal with one of them.
I watched my brother and my cousins play on the computers for a while.
Then they had to go to bed and I was getting tired, so I got my teeth brushes and went to sleep.
