June 22, 2020 - Monday
I woke up late this morning and just hung out in my room after I brushed my teeth.
Once it got to be noon I loaded the trash bag into the car and then headed over to my grandparents’ house.
On our way there I stopped the car infront of a playground so my brother could do Pokémon Go (video game) thing.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house it was just a regular day of eating and chilling.
The main two things I did while chilling were watch cartoons on YouTube and listen to music.
After I got home in the night I had some mail for me on the counter so I got that.
Then I started to get ready for bed.
My plan was to listen to some music with my friend Sarah after I finished, but right before I started flossing my teeth my dad called me.
He wanted me to help him outside in the shed which ended up taking a couple hours.
By that time it was a bit too late to listen to music.
So I finished getting ready for bed then washed the dishes.
I got distracted for a little bit afterwards, but got back on track after a while, wrote this up, and went to bed.
