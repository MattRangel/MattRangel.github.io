June 20, 2020 - Saturday
For breakfast this morning I had some cereal.
I forgot that there was leftover pizza so I ate some of that a little while after my breakfast.
Then I came back downstairs till about noon.
At that time my cousin Dagan drove my brother and I to downtown, so they could play some Pokémon Go.
I don’t play the game so I came along to just hang out.
We came back to the house and hung out for a while.
I took a shower and watched more YouTube on my phone.
Also ate another slice of pizza after my shower.
Then we all three went back out to downtown so they could play some more.
Once we got back home we all went downstairs to watch a movie.
They ended up choosing the movie Scream which I only half watched while I texted with my friend Sarah.
Ended up going to bed late once again tonight.
Thankfully we aren’t waking up too early to leave so I’ll still have time to rest.
