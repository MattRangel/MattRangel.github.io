June 15, 2020 - Monday
I woke up at my normal time today.
My dad took my brother to Austin to get his learner’s driver licence.
That meant I was going just by myself to my grandparents’ house in the morning.
So I decided to just go to my grandparents’ house early and eat some breakfast over there.
While I was getting ready my friend Yamiel texted me asking if I wanted to go skateboard.
I texted him that I do, and so I got my skateboarding things put into the car and drove over to his house to pick him up.
When we got to the skate park there was no one else there which was pretty nice.
We switched between playing footbag and skateboarding.
I feel like I got a better just from the little bit of practicing I did today, but I’m for sure not a master by no means... yet! haha
After I dropped Yamiel back off at his house I headed over to my grabdparents’ house.
Over there I had gumbo for lunch and dinner.
In-between meals I just watched youtube videos nothing too notable￼.
Once I got back home I ate a portion if my cotton candy ice cream that I got a few days ago but forgot about.
Following the ice cream I got my teeth brushed then just hung out until it was time for me to wrap up my day and go to bed.
