June 18, 2020 - Thursday
I woke up at my normal time this morning even though I went to bed late last night.
I spent the morning and a bit of the afternoon hanging out on my phone, playing on the computer, and eating.
On the computer I played minecraft with my brother.
When I ate it was cereal and also some pasta that my dad made.
In the afternoon I went to this graduation party thing at a brewery and ate some natchos.
Once I got back I just went back to switching between chilling on my phone and playing on the computer.ï¿¼
Ending my night off I texted with my friend Sarah some and then listened to an album with her.
I ended up going to bed late again tonight, which will probably be a trend during this vacation haha.
This was a pretty short one, because I spent the majority of my time doing the same few things.
