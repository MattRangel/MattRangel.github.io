May 5, 2020 - Friday
For breakfast I ate some SpaghettiOs and a banana.
After breakfast I went outside and helped my dad build a second work bench.
That took a very long time, and by the time we were done it was well past lunch time.
So we ate a late lunch of eggs, rice, and refried beans.
Then I drove out to my friend Ben’s house to hang out with him and another friend Darious.
We swam for a while then ate dinner.
After dinner we all went to Darious’ house.
At his house we played some pool and also darts.
Then I came back home.
Once I got home I got ready for bed and then listened to music with my friend Sarah for a little bit.
I went to bed pretty late tonight but it’s fine.
