June 10, 2020 - Wednesday
After eating my breakfast this morning my dad told me that we were going to go back to working after eating lunch.
It was nice to have some free time instead of just going right to work.
I made the rice for lunch and my dad made some steak (I think), beans, and squash.
After lunch we didn’t end up working for another few hours.
Once my dad finally did call me my task was to start the mowing.
So I mowed until it got dark and also the lawn mower stopped working.
My dad and I ended up having to pull it using the truck.
After that I came inside and took a shower.
I waited a bit for my mom to come home and then I watched the movie “13th” (2016).
I also ate some oatmeal for dinner while I watched.
Following the movie I got all ready for bed
I then ended my night listening to some music with my friend Sarah.
I went to bed late again tonight, so I guess the plan is to just try and make double sure I don’t mess up tomorrow.
