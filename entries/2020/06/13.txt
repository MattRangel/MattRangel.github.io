June 13, 2020 - Saturday
This morning I woke up and watched some youtube videos and searched on the internet for some electronic things.
Once my mom got back home from the gym it was about time to start getting ready to go to my friend Madi’s mom’s wedding.
I took a shower, got dressed up, and the waited for my mom to finish getting ready.
I drove the whole three hours to the church.
A little bit before we got to the church I stopped at a gas station so my mom and I could go to the bathroom.
While we were there we each got one of thoes rectangle boxed pies.
I got an apple one while my mom got a cherry one and also a carmel cookie.
Once we got to the church building we sat in the car and ate our snacks before going inside.
After the church service we went to the building behind the church.
Over there we sat down at a table with a few people my mom knew.
We ate dinner and watched the couple dance before leaving to go home.
On our way home I stopped at Sonic to get a cake batter shake and use a free Red Bull slushie cupon.
The ended up not having ice cream so I only got the Red Bull slush.
That was actually the first energy drink I’ve ever had.
I didn’t really notice too much energy gained from the energy drink to be honest.
Once I got home I got in pajamas and then brushed my teeth.
I went to write this entry and kept getting distracted texting with my friend Sarah.
So I ended up going to bed pretty late again.
I have two days to get back to fully well rested before my family drives to Iowa, which is totally possible! (Not! haha)
