I actually woke up at my normal time this morning for the first time in a while.
After I was up I wrote up the letter to the judge that’s going to deal with my traffic ticket situation.
My mom helped me a lot with that and then she took it to the post office for me.
Then I ate my breakfast which was a can of SpaghettiOs.
I went to my room to play on my computer, but my dad called me before I got a chance to fire anything up.
He wanted me to finish the mowing which he got started last night.
So I got to mowing which took up the rest of the morning and well into the afternoon.
Once I was done I waited for my mom to finish taking a shower then I took my shower.
After that I ate the dinner my dad made.
That was chicken, rice, and beans.
Following dinner I went to my room and relaxed for a while.
Then my dad asked my brother and I if we wanted to go get ice cream.
We both said yes and I drove the car to Dairy Queen.
On our way back home I pulled over next to a corn field so my dad could teach us some things about it which was nice.
Once I got back home I hopped on my computer and played Minecraft with a few friends.
The server we used was one that I got a 30 day free trial of, so I’m not sure if I’ll keep buying after that’s over.
They all had to get off for various reasons one by one.
So I got off to once it was just me.
I switched over to a different game called Roblox.
Played that for a little while then got off, because it was approaching the time I wanted to go to bed.
I hung out on my phone after getting off my computer which ended up putting me past the time I wanted to sleep.
After I got the energy to get up I went and brushed my teeth then went to bed.
It only ended up being about 30 minutes past the time I was shooting for which is still pretty good.
