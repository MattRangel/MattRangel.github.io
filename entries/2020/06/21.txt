Today was my family’s last day in Iowa.
After I woke up and got my teeth brushed I ate some cereal for breakfast.
I am glad that we don’t keep that stuff back at home, because it really isn’t the best for me at all.
There was a little bit of hangout time before we started loading up the car.
We said our goodbyes to my aunt, uncle and cousins, and also took a few photos.
Then we were on our way.
My dad started off the driving.
Before he passed it to my mom we got some sandwiches at Jimmy John’s.
Mine was just a plain ham and cheese one.
After our lunch my mom took over the driving for the next little while.
At about 5 pm I switched with my mom and started driving.
My dad got donuts and my brother got Gatorade for everyone at the gas station we were stopped at.
I actually finished out the rest of the driving on my own getting home at around 12:30 am.
I quickly got my things unpacked and put away then got ready for bed.
Went to bed late again tonight, but that’ll make it easy to fall asleep at my normal time tomorrow.
