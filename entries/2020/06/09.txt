June 9, 2020 - Tuesday
This morning I layed in bed for quite a while after waking up just because I didn’t feel like brushing my teeth and washing my face.
I did end up getting out of bed of course.
The rest of my time at home before leaving to my grandparents’ house I spent listening to music and watching youtube.
Once I got over to my grandparents’ house I pretty much just continued what I was doing back at home.
I watched the movie “Last Action Hero” (1993).
After the movie I went back to watching youtube.
Right when I got back home my dad asked me to help him outside.
So for the next few hours I was outside working in the shed.
Then I came back inside and got my teeth brushed and washed the dishes.
I then cut my nails.
After all that I stayed up into the night texting and listening to music with my friend Sarah.
By the time I went to bed it was really late, so I’m definitely going to have to make an effort to go to bed on time tomorrow.
