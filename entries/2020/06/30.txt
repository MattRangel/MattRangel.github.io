June 30, 2020 - Tuesday
I spent the morning before leaving to my grandparents’ house just hanging out on my phone.
Over at my grandparents’ house while I wasn’t eating I was talking with friends.
When I wasn’t doing that I was just scrolling through social media things.
Once I got back home I got ready for bed then played Minecraft on the computer with my friends Gena and Jon.
After they got off I wrote this up and went to bed a little while afterwards.
Today’s entry was definitely￼ one of the less detailed ones.
