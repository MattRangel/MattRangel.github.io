I woke up early this morning, because I was going to go Frisco.
My friend/my mom’s friend’s son was there visiting his father.
Once we were all three in the car ready to go we headed over there.
We picked up Lucas and the headed over to a Mexican restaurant for lunch.
Then we headed over to a the National Videogame Museum.
We thought it was closed for a moment, but it turns out that it was not.
After we finished up there we went to an escape room place.
We were able to beat it, but only with the help of one of the workers.
It was kind of late in the afternoon by that time so we dropped Lucas back off.
On our way back home we stopped and my uncle Stevie and aunt Polly’s house.
We all went to get some ice cream at Dairy Queen after surprising￼ them.
Then we were on our way home for real.
On the drive back home I got a speeding ticket which is really not fun.
That’s going to take up a lot of my money and I’m not going to speed anymore for sure haha.
After I got home I got ready for bed.
Then I stayed up a little while more before finally going to bed kind of late.
