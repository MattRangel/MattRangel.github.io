June 27, 2020 - Saturday
The majority of today was a blur of eating, playing on my computer, and going to my phone.
I switched through those three things for the morning.
At some point my dad left with my brother to go buy a zero turn lawn mower he found a good deal on.
After they left I cooked up some rice and at that along with a bit of leftover chicken from yesterday for my lunch.
Then I went back to my room.
Some of the games I played on my computer today were Minesweeper, Minecraft, and Bust-A-Move.
For dinner I ate the same thing as I did for lunch.
After dinner I went outside to help my dad and brother.
They were picking up metal posts that had been left in the yard quite a long time ago.
Once they were all picked up I mowed down the tall grass that had grown around them.
I then headed back inside and took a shower.
After my shower I was going to play Minecraft with my friends again but none of them were available.
So I played by myself for a little bit.
At the end of my night I group called with my friends￼ to show them something and ended up talking for a while.
Once I was done talking I got my teeth brushed and then went to bed.
Going to bed like an hour past my goal, but I had fun talking and texting with friends so it’s fine.
