May 3, 2020 - Wednesday
I woke up a while later than I normally do this morning.
Once I was up I ate a breakfast of SpaghettiOs and microwaved taquitos.
While I ate I continued watching thr movie “Stranger Than Paradise” (1984), which I started last night.
I went back to my room for a bit until around lunch time.
My dad called me to the kitchen to make the rice for lunch.
He cooked chicken, celery and some carrots.
Following lunch I went back to my room again, but not for too long.
My dad called me again to help him outside.
I ended up spending the rest of the afternoon helping him construct a work bench out of a door and some other pieces of wood.
We did finish all of it though and it turned out pretty good.
Once I got back inside I took a shower and then watched the movie “Salt” (2010).
While I took my shower my mom did my dishes for me which was really nice.
During the movie I ate some cereal and marshmallows.
After the movie I got ready for bed, did the few dishes that were left, and then went to sleep.
I went to bed late again tonight.
Hopefully this is not the start of something bad haha.
