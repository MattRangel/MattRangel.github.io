May 4, 2020 - Thursday
I didn’t do too much besides scroll through my phone and watch youtube videos this morning.
I drove my dad’s truck to my grandparents’ house today, because my normal car had to be left at home to have a chip repaired.
I continued the not doing too much after getting to my there.
I did watch the movie “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” (2012).
Once I got back home I went on my walk with my mom.
I spent the rest of the night listening to music with Sarah which I haven’t done in a while.
