June 7, 2020 - Sunday
For breakfast this morning I ate taquitos, a bowl of cereal, and a banana.
After I ate breakfast I went out to the shed and got started on cleaning the floor up.
For the rest of the day I was outside working with my dad.
Taking one break in the middle of that to go hardware store and also grab some pizza for a late lunch.
After getting home and eatting my pizza I went right back to work all the way till day.
Once I was done working I came inside and took a shower.
Then I got on the phone with my friend Sarah.
I talked with her all the way up until I went to bed.
I did end up going to bed kind of late, but the reason why definitely made it fine haha.
