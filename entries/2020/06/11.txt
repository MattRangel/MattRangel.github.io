This morning I layed in bed on my phone for a really long time before getting up and brushing my teeth.
The majority of my time at hone this morning I was looking at footbag things. (I used to call it hacky sack in these entries, but I’ve just realized that “hacky sack” is a brand. It can be called both but I am not going to use the brand name from here on out.)
I think I want to sew my own footbag after having looked in to it a bit this morning.
Over at my grandparents’ house I brought my computer, but did not end up putting on a movie.
I mainly just watched youtube videos on my phone.
To go with dinner my grandma and I made some churros together.
Once I got back home I got my teeth brushed.
By the time I finished that I actually had some time left over.
So I spent the rest of the night, and a little bit past the time I planned to go to bed, listening to some music with my friend Sarah.
