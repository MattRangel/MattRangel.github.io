My school day took a little longer than usual, but that’s because I spent a while working ahead.
Towards the end of my school day I went with my dad to the bank.
We were going to see about transfering an old minors bank account to me.
It ended up that we’d have to close the old account and open a new one, so we just didn’t worry about it.
Before dropping me back off at my grandparents’ house my dad stopped at the grocery store and then the gas station.
Then I went back inside and finished the rest of my school work.
There wasn’t too much time before dinner by the time I actually finished up.
After I got back home I helped my dad play the news on the TV.
Then I asked my brother if he wanted to skateboard with me outside.
He said yes and so I put my shoes on and grabbed the stero to play music.
We were out there for a bit until I started to get tired.
I am actually seeing myself getting better now that I’m consistently practicing￼￼ which is super cool.
I was going to take a shower once I came inside, but I got distracted watching the presidential debate.
After it was over I hung out for a little bit more before getting myself to take a shower.
Following that I did the dishes.
Then I put on an interesting video for my mom to watch while she works.
Next I got my teeth brushed and then went to sleep.
I went to sleep at a bad time tonight which is disappointing, because I was doing good on time right until I got distracted watching TV.￼
