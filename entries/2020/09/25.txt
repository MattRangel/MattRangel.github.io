September 25, 2020 - Friday
I had hardly any schoolwork legt to do today.
After I finished it all I layed down and listened to some music.
I ended up falling asleep all the way until it was time to eat dinner.
Once I got back home I waited for my mom to get home and then we watched some movies.
The first one was “Bad Boys” (1983).
Next movie was called “Frequency” (2000).
Lastly we watched “Colombiana” (2011).
After that I stayed sitting on the couch and procrastinated getting ready for bed for a while.
Once I finally did it was super late.
