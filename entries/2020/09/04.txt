September 4, 2020 - Friday
I slept very bad last night.
For the first half of the night my rash kept waking my up every hour.
For breakfast I ate some leftovers from the fridge.
Later in the day I droke my brother, mom, and dad to go tour my brother’s new school.
After that we went to a mexican restaurant and the to Fredd’s to get some ice creame.
Once I got back home I spent the rest of the afternoon making sausages with my dad.
Following that I watched the movie “Red Dragon” (2002).
Next I took some pill for my rash and then got ready for bed.
I also put on some more rash lotion which I realized I was putting to little of.
Then I went to bed super late.
I also hace to wake up early tomorrow, so hopefully my brain won’t be too wacked out.
