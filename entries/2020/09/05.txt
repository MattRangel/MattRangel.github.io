September 5, 2020 - Saturday
I didn’t sleep well again tonight because of my rash.
I got out of bed earlier than I normally do so I could leave to my grandparents’ house early amd also because I couldn’t fall asleep.
The reason I went to my grandparents’ house so early on a Saturday is because there was a working coming in the morning to install their new wifi.
Once I got to their house I ate breakfast.
Later on I tried putting oat meal water on my rash.
(Note: I feel asleep for a few hours in the middle of writing that last sentence haha!)
My grandma made lunch for me and then I headed over to Walmart to meet my friend Darious.
Once he finally got there we went into the store and bought our friend Ben a birthday card and some snacks.
We didn’t swim at Ben’s house today because I didn’t want to mess with my rash which was not itching too bad.
We played some board games.
Later we went to Texas Roadhouse for dinner.
I got a steak thing with onions and mushrooms which was good.
Leaving the resturant I got a text from my friend Yamiel who works there saying he saw me.
We drove back to Ben’s house after dinner and then I dropped off Darious.
On my way home my mom called me saying the rest of the family was going to go get pizzas and if I wanted one.
I didn’t want one, because I just ate.
Once I got home I just went to my room and hung out until my family got back home.
At that point I turned on the movie “ The Silence of the Lambs” (1991).
Right after that movie I spent the next good while putting more oatmeal water on my rash.
Once I was finished with that I got ready for bed then went to sleep.
