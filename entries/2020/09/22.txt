September 22, 2020 - Tuesday
I spent most of my time today working on school work.
The thing that took so long was an about me presentation.
It wasnâ€™t really difficult it just got dragged out by me being on my phone.
One phone thing I did was make a groupchat with my friend Kai while we looked for the person who commented on my site.
The groupchat has us two and then two other people we thought might be it.
It ended up that neither of them were the commenter, but we all stayed around in the groupchat.
I helped my grandma bake the crescent rolls for dinner.
Once I got back home the first thing I did was brush my teeth.
Then I got the dishes washed.
There was a medium amount, because I forgot to wash them yesterday.
After the dishes I just hung out for the rest of the night.
I went to bed less late than I did yesterday which is good because I have a dentist appointment I have to wake up early for tomorrow.
