September 10, 2020 - Thursday
This morning I visibly noticed my rash is starting to get better.
Today was the first cold day after summer.
I had to go back inside and put on a hoodie.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house for online school.
There still hasn’t been too much work assigned, so I’ve had quite a bit of free time.
The last thing I worked on for school was a digital drawing, but it didn’t have to take so long I was just doing a lot for fun.
After school I took a shower and then ate dinner.
My drive home was alone today, because my brother left earlier to go work out at the gym with my mom.
Before heading home I filled up the gas though.
Once I got home I plopped down in my bed until it was time to go to bed.
I need to work a little better on my nightime planning, because I went to bed late again tonight.
