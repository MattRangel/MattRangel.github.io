This morning I had to wake up an hour early to go to the dentist.
I was a little  late getting there, because there was some road construction that delayed the drive.
It turned out fin though and my teeth were all clean and had no cavaties.
After the dentist my brother and I met my mom at Jimmy’s Egg to eat breakfast.
This time I chose a cinnamon roll flavored waffle which was pretty good.
Next my brother and I headed over to my grandparents’ house to get our school day started.
My school day and the time after was pretty average.
I just hung out after I finished my school for the day.
I was able to say goodbye to my dad who stopped by the house before leaving to go work out of state.
Once I got home I did the dishes.
Then I played bean bag tic tac toe with my mom for a bit.
The first game we played actually took quite a while.
After that we played one more game and then I started getting ready for bed.
I was on my phone during the gap inbetween each of thoes things which led to me going to sleep super late.
