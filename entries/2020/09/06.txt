September 6, 2020 - Sunday
I still woke up in the middle of my sleep last night, but it was definitley better than the past few days.
I was also abls to get a full night’s rest for the first time in a while.
Once I was up I brushed my teeth and then ate some watermelon that my dad cut up.
When my mom got back home from the gym she had some more things for me to try putting on my rash.
A little bit after my mom getting home her friend came here.
A while after that we all ate lunch.
For lunch we ate ribs, sausage, rice, and beans.
After lunch I went and hung out in my room for the next little bit.
Later I had to drive my brother to a quinceañera practice.
Instead of driving all the way back home after dropping him off I went to my grandparents’ house.
Over there I ate some fruit and then worked on downloading Linux for my grandfather’s computer, because Windows runs super slow.
I didn’t end up having enough time to get it done and had to pause to go pick up my brother.
Once we got home I finished setting up a Linux USB, so I can install it next time I go over to my grandparents’ house.
Next I watched a movie with my mom.
We were going to watch the next Hannibal movie, but it wasn’t on Netflix and also didn’t have the best rating.
So instead we found the movie “American Assassin” (2017).
During the movie I ate some of the rice krispies treats my mom amd brother made.
Following the movie I washed the large amount of dishes there were.
They took a long time, but I stayed up later after finishing them to put on a paste on my rash.
The paste ended up not washing off easily so I had to rub it off which flared up my rash a lot.
After that I brushed my teeth and went to sleep.
I went to bed super late and I just really hope I don’t have any sleeping troubles.
