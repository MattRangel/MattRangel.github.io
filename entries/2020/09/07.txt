September 7, 2020 - Monday
I didn’t well last night and spent most of the night awake trying different things to get my rash to stop itching.
Nothing I tried ended up really working for me, so ai was trying new things throughout the whole day.
Once I got hungry for breakfast I ate a can of SpaghettiOs.
I chilled in my room for the rest of the morning.
In the afternoon I had a video conference with a Director of Undergraduate Programs from Baylor along with my mom and dad.
After that there was a family ordeal.
Next I went back to trying more stuff on my rash.
I also ate a lunch of sausage, rice, and beans.
Was hanging out some more when my dad asked if we wanted to get ice cream.
My brother came too and we each bought a pint of ice cream.
Once I got back home I put more stuff on my rash then ate my icecream outside.
I also made plans with my mom to go to the clinic to get my rash checked out.
Then I took shower and put another thing on my rash.
Next I went to my room and layed down until it was time to start getting ready for bed.
My mom did the dishes for me tonight which I’m very greatful for and also saved a bit of time.
I brushed my teeth then took a shower.
I went to bed on time for the first time in a really long while.
