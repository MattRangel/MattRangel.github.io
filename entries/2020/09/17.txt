September 17, 2020 - Thursday
My school day today was even shorter than yesterday.
After I finished my school I watched the movie “After Hours” (1985).
Next I spent the rest of the afternoon playing Roblox on my computer with my friebds Sherry.
I got off obve it was time to eat dinner and then headed home.
Once I got home I sat down with my mom to watch the movie we started last night.
I ended up falling asleep though.
Then U brushed my teeth and just hung out in my room for the rest of the night.
