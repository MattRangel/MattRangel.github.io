September 17, 2020 - Thursday
My school day today was even shorter than yesterday.
After I finished my school I watched the movie “After Hours” (1985).
Next I spent the rest of the afternoon playing Roblox on my computer with my friend Sherry.
We haven’t played anything in a while so it was cool to talk with her again.
I got off once it was time to eat dinner and then I headed home.
Once I got home I sat down with my mom to watch the rest of the movie we started last night.
I ended up falling asleep though.
Then I brushed my teeth and just hung out in my room for the rest of the night.
I went to bed a little late, but not as late as last night which is good.
