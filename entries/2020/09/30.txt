September 30, 2020 - Wednesday
My school day was pretty normal today.
After I finished school I just hung out on my phone.
I was going to watch a movie, but I was too tired to put my energy towards that.
Once I got back home I washed the dishes.
Then I watched a movie with my mom.
We were going to watch a documentary, but my dad wanted to watch it too so we decided to wait for him.
The movie we ended up watching which I canâ€™t remeber the name of.
Following that I got my teeth brushed.
I stayed up a little while longer after that listening to music.
I stayed up a little late, but better that yesterday which is good.
