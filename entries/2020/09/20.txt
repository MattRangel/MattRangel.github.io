September 20, 2020 - Sunday
I still woke up at my normal time today.
For the whole morning I worked on my new project I thought of last night.
I took a pause when my I went to help my dad load up a greenhouse in the truck to return.
After we finished loading it up I rode along with him while he returned it.
Next we went to a couple more places then headed home.
Once we got back home I went back to working on my project.
I worked on that until I had to take my brother to church class.
After I got back I did the dishes then brushed my teeth.
Next I just hung out for a bit until my mom got back home
Once she was back I went on a walk with her.
Following the walk I just hung out for the rest of the night until it was time to go to bed.
