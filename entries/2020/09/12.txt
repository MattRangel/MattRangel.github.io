September 12, 2020 - Saturday
I slept really late all the way into the afternoon today.
As I was waking up my brother was getting ready to go out to a quinceañera.
So I got up and quickly got dressed to ride along with him and my mom to drop him off.
After my mom dropped him off she got a carwash and then we headed back home.
At home I heated up my mom and I each our own frozen pot pie for lunch.
Following lunch I headed out to hang out with my friends Ben and Darious.
They went swimming for a little bit, which I didn’t do because I didn’t want to flare up my rash.
After we were done hanging out at Ben’s house we went over to Darious’ house.
On the way there we stopped at Sonic where I got a smores shake.
At Darious’ house we played some board games.
Once I got home I went to watch a movie with my parents, which actually ended up being a TV show.
I didn’t really care for it so I left after a while.
My parents both left to go pick up my brother.
Then I took a shower and got ready for bed.
After I was done getting ready to go to sleep I got a text from my dad asking for me to pick him up.
So I drove out to him and got him.
Once I got back home I helped him with his Android TV box for a while.
Then I actually went to bed.
My bed time tonight was even worse than it was yesterday.
