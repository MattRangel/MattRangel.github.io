September 21, 2020 - Monday
My school day today was once again pretty easy.
After I finished school I atarted working on my project from yesterday again.
I worked on it the whole time I was at my grandparents’ house taking a couple breaks to eat.
Once I got back home I used the hard drive to usb adapter my dad got in the mail.
We were checking if my brother’s harddrives were corrpted.
One of them was and the other only partially I think.
After that I worked on my project some more.
I ended up finishing it, but I stayed up too late doing it.
Next I brushed my teeth and then went to my room.
I stayed up for a bit more, because I kept getting distracted.
My bedtime tonight was pretty late, so I might even need to take a nap tomorrow.
