September 16, 2020 - Wednesday
I got my school day finished today even quicker than than yesterday and monday.
Doing all my work at home opposed to at school definitely helps me get done much quicker.
After school I finished watching the movie “Léon” (1994) which I started last night.
Then I watched the movie “American Beauty” (1999).
By the time I was done with the second movie I had already finished eating dinner and it was time to go home.
Once I got home I helped my dad outside move something real quick before going inside.
Then I hung out in my room until my mom got home.
When she got home we sat down and looked for a movie to watch.
It took three tries but we eventually chose to watch “The Last Days of American Crime” (2020).
Since we took so long to find a movie we decided we were going to only watch some and finish the rest tomorrow.
We stopped once my dad came inside and I started helping him fix my brother’s computer.
I ended up staying up super late, but half of that was on me.
We finished working with the computer still not really functioning properly.
What made me go to bed so late was taking too much time to brush my teeth and wash the dishes.
I am for sure going to need to make up for this tomorrow by going to sleep at a very good time.
