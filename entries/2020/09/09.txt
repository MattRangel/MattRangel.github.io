September 9, 2020 - Wednesday
This morning I woke up early to eat breakfast with my mom.
We each made a bowl of oatmeal.
I was only able to finish half of my bowl, because I wasn’t super hungry.
The reason I ate breakfast was to hahg out with my mom in the morning as well as be able to take my rash pill with food.
After breakfast I did my normal morning routine modified to help my rash.
Then I left to go to my grandparents’ house.
My school day was pretty easy as I’m still just doing intro to class stuff.
During my lumch break I ate the lasagna my grandma made.
Afrer my school was over I layed down and ended up accidentally falling asleep.
Once I woke up it was already time to eat dinner.
So I did that and then headed home.
Once I got home I watched a movie called “Spenser Confidential” (2020).
After the movie I took a shower and put on my hydrocortisone cream (rash cream) which took a while.
Them I brushed my teeth and washed the dishes.
I went to bed late again tonight.
I’m hoping I’ll be able to get my speep on schedule￼ once my rash gones down.
