September 18, 2020 - Friday
I had hardly any school work left to do today since I did most of it earlier in the week.
After I finished school I just spent the rest of the day hanging out on my phone.
Shortly after I got back home my dad called the family outside to show us the pizza oven he just finished cleaning up.
Next he got us all into the car and drove us out to a suprise.
The suprise was a new Italian ice cream place.
I got banana ice with vanilla ice cream.
It was pretty good.
Once I got back home I was going to put on a movie to watch with my parents, but my I was kind of tired to watch a movie.
So I decided to just watch it tomorrow instead.
I got ready for bed and then went to my room.
Then I got out my computer and spent the rest of my night playing Roblox with my friend Kai and a new friend.
Once they got off I did to and then went to sleep.
