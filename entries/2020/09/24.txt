September 24, 2020 - Thursday
My school day was nice and quick today.
After school I played some roblox for a while.
Then I layed down and watched YouTube and TikTok.
My brother had to go to school in person, so my drive back home was all alone.
Before going home I made a stop at walmart.
I got some golden rasins, because I liked the flavoured ones and I wanted to try them plain.
Turns out that I do like rasins after making it up in my head that I didn’t for so long.
Once I got home I went outside and practiced my skateboarding for a little bit.
Following that I then practiced playing foot bag.
Next I took a shower because I was all sweaty.
Then I watched the movie “Real Steel” (2011) with my brother.
During the movie I ate some ice cream and a hand full of my raisins.
After the movie was over I stayed sitting on the couch for a little bit before I got the energy to get ready for bed.
I stayed up for a little bit after that listening to music.
