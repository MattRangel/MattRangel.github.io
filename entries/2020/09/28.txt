September 28, 2020 - Monday
It’s starting to get cold outside now which I like.
The refreshing cold weather during the fall season is very nice.
My school day today took a bit longer than usual.
After I finally finished I put on some music and then took a nap.
I woke up to eat a snack and then another time to eat dinner.
When I got home I immediately￼ washed the dishes and then brushed my teeth.
Next I changed the air filters to the house.
Following that I went outside and practiced skateboarding for a while and listened to a CD on my stereo.
I was out there until my mom came outside to see if I wanted to watch a movie.
I agreed and then came inside to take a shower.
After I finished showering we watched the movie “Inside Man” (2006).
Following the movie I went and laid in bed on my phone and procrastinated writing this entry.
I went to sleep much better than yesterday, but still pretty bad.
