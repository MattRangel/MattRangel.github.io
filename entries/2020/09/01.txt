September 1, 2020 - Tuesday
My first wake up this morning was my mom telling me that her stock that she bought went up in price.
It took a moment for my brain to get running, but once it was I help her sell one stock.
Then I went back to sleep until my alarm woke me up.
After brushing my teeth I practiced my reading in spanish for a bit.
Next I sent an email to my school about the faulty computer they gave me.
Following that I ate some cheese crackers and then hung out in my room until it was time to go to my grandparents’ house.
Once I got over there I ate lunch and the finished watching the movie “Meantime” (1984) which I started yesterday.
After that I was just watching youtube for the rest of the afternoon.
Later on I had to set up the sprinklers which took a little while because I had to adjust them for the wind.
Followong that I took a shower then ate dinner.
Next I headed home.
I hung out at home for a while before getting started on the dishes.
After I did them I brushed my teeth and then stayed up even more watching youtube and then listening to music.
