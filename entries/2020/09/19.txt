September 19, 2020 - Saturday
I woke up at my normal time this morning.
After getting my teeth brushed I soent the rest of my morning playing Roblox.
After that I just hung out for a bit.
Then I listened to music with my friend Erin who I haven’t talked to in ages.
I listened to music with her until my dad called for me to help him cook.
We were making homemade pizzas with my dad’s new pizza oven.
We also prepared sausages for another day.
Cooking up those two things took all the way until late in the afternoon.
By the time I actually finished eating it was turning night time.
After dinner I watched the movie “Leave No Trace” (2018) with my mom.
During the movie I ate a bowl of cereal for dessert.
Towards the end of the movie my dad and brother went out and brought back some ice cream for me.
I didn’t eat any though since it was so late.
After the movie I brushed my teeth and then went back to my room.
I got on Roblox and played with my friend Kai for a good while.
Once we got off I was going to go to bed, but I got distracted by thinking up a new project idea.
Looking into my new idea actually kept me up quite a bit later.
I ended up going to sleep super late tonight.
