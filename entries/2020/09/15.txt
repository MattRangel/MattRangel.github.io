September 15, 2020 - Tuesday
My school day today was pretty much just like yesterday.
I did my classes and then went to watching Netflix.
I finished watching the new season of my show by the time it was time to leave my grandparents’ house.
When I got back home I started watching the movie “Léon” (1994).
I took a pause to wash the dishes snd brush my teeth.
Then I went back to watching it until it was time to go to bed.
I didn’t have time to finish it so I’ll be watching the rest tomorrow.
