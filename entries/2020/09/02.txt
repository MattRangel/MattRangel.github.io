September 2, 2020 - Wednesday
This morning my mom helped me find some ointment to put on the rash I have on my neck and face, because it was pretty itchy.
I also cut my nails which I’ve been forgetting to do for a while.
For lunch I helped my dad make shrimp rice.
I was looking at my schedule for school and realized my school starts next Tuesday not Wednesday.
So I had to email the Baylor professor with my dad asking to reschedule our video call.
Luckly she was able to move it to Monday.
After that I drove my mom to the bank and Walmart.
My dad and brother also came along for the ride.
I went into the Walmart looking for a new Minecraft cereal, but they didn’t have it.
I ended up going to the other Walmart just to get it.
Once I got back home I ate a bowl of my cereal.
Then I put on a movie to watch with my mom and dad.
First we watched “Catch Me If You Can” (2001) and then “Shutter Island” (2010).
During the second movie my dad left to buy a different type of ointment for the rash I have.
After that I washed the dishes, got ready for bed, and then put some more ointment on.
I still went to bed kind of late, but with the rash I want to try to get all my sleep so it has lots of time yo heal.
