September 26, 2020 - Saturday
This morning I was pretty tired after waking up, so I really didn’t do too much.
After a bit I hand washed some of my underwear, because I ran out and didn’t want to start a whole load of laundry just for my underwear.
Then after setting it us to dry I rewatched the movie “Chappie” (2015) with my brother.
During that I ate some junk food for breakfast.
After that movie once my mom got home I watched another movie movie.
This movie was “Bad Boys” (1995).
Following that movie I went to my room to hang out for a little bit.
After a while my mom called for me and asked me to sweep the house.
Once I finished the sweeping I took a shower.
Next I got in the car with my mom and brother and we all went to eat.
For dinner we went to an Asian place where I tried noodle soup and some sushi.
Following dinner we went and got smoothies for dessert.
Mine was just plain banana, which I finished pretty much all the way on the way home.
Once I got home I played Roblox with my friend Kai and also some other people here and there for the rest of the night.
After I got off I got my teeth brushed and I then went to sleep.
