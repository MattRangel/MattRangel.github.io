September 13, 2020 - Sunday
After waking up this morning I went to a restaurant called Jimmy’s Egg with my mom.
We drove separatley since my mom had to go somewhere else after.
I got a cinnamon roll and apple oat meal.
After eating I went and took my car through an automatic car wash.
Following the car wash I headed back home.
I just hung out for a while after getting back.
Once I got hungry again I ate some SpaghettiOs.
As I was in the middle of eating them my dad asked if I wanted to eat some chicken.
I said yes and then put the rest of my SpaghettiOs in the fridge.
Then I helped cook the rice and went back to hanging out.
Once my mom got back home we sat down and looked for a movie to watch on Netflix.
We found the movie “Donnie Brasco” (1997), but as we found it dinner was getting finished.
So we waited until after we ate to watch the movie.
After the movie I finished washing the dishes.
Then I got my teeth brushed and just hung out for a while until it was time to go to bed.
I went to bed at a pretty good time tonight, and hopefully I can keep doing that.
