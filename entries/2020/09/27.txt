September 27, 2020 - Sunday
Today was just a day of hanging out and eating.
I was going to maybe hang out with my friends Ben and Darious, but that never ended up happening.
In the afternoon I took my brother to his church class.
I practiced skateboarding a little today, but I was too tired from staying up late to keep going after a while.
Once my mom got back home after finishing at my brother’s church class we watched a movie.
I made some popcorn for the movoe while my mom talked on the phone for a bit.
The popcorn ended up being a little bit too salty, but it was still edible.
The movie we watched was “The Grand Budapest Hotel” (2014).
After the movie I stayed sitting down and procrastinated weapping up the day for a really long time.
Once I finally got the energy I washed the dishes, took a shower, and then brushed my teeth.
By the time I went to bed it was super late.
