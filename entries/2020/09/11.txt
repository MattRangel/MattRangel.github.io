September 11, 2020 - Friday
Note: I fell asleep before writing this one, so it’s going to be a little less detailed.
My school day today was pretty easy, because I had most of school work for the day already done.
In the night I watched the movie “Shot Caller” (2017) and then the movie “Defiance” (2008) with my parents.
Watching both of those movies made me go to bed super late.
