September 14, 2020 - Monday
I took a shower after brushing my teeth this morning which I don’t normally do, but my hair was a little messy.
My school day today was pretty uneventful.
I didn’t have to join any video calls and finished all my work a couple hours early.
I think I’ll probably start getting more work soon, but the workload right now is pretty nice.
After that I just hung out and watched Netflix for the rest of the day.
When I got back home I watched some more Netflix.
I stayed up a little bit late watching my friend shave his hair off on an Instagram live video.
After that I went to bed just a bit later than my goal.
