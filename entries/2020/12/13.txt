December 13, 2020 - Sunday
After waking up this morning I hung out on my phone for a little while before getting up and brushing my teeth.
I ate a bowl of apple sauce for my breakfast.
Then I went to my room and hung out for a while.
I was sitting at my desk thinking about doing a drawing for a bit.
While I was doing that my dad and brother were getting ready to go to the store.
My brother came up to me and asked me to draw something for him.
So while they were gone I drew my brother a photo I had taken of us a few months ago and gave it to him when he got back.
I helped my dad cook lunch which was steak and egg tacos.
Following lunch I cleaned the dishes and then went back to my room for a bit.
Later on I watched the movie “Metropolitan” (1990) with my mom.
We paused the movie half way through to eat dinner.
For dinner we had beef, rice, and refried beans tacos.
Going back to the movie agter dinner I finished the rest if the ice cream my parents got me last week.
Following the movie I shaved and then washed the dishes.
Next my dad took a photo of me so I could print out a photo of myself for my Colombian ID card.
I tried to edit a suit onto myself, but it looked off.
So instead my dad let me wear his suit and took a photo of me in that.
After removing my background I printed out the photos to the correct size.
Then my dad and I cut them out.
While I was putting away supplies my mom and brother came back home from church class.
I said hello to them and then went back to my room for a bit.
My mom called my brother and I to play a family game of Uno.
After we played a couple times I got my teeth brushed.
Then I was going to look at the shooting stars outside with my dad and brother, but the clouds were blocking the whole sky.
I then went back to my room and hung out for a bit too long before writing this entry up and going to sleep.
