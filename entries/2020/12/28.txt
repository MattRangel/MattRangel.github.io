December 28, 2020 - Monday
I woke up pretty early this morning, but I ended up going back to sleep instead of getting out of bed.
After I got out of bed for real I got my teeth brushed and then just hung out until it was time for my brother and I to go to my grandparents’ house.
My hanging out turned into researching for a new laptop, because my mom’s computer isn’t able to run her work program very well.
I ended up leaving a little later than usual, because I got kind of distracted looking.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house I ate lunch and then went back to looking into a computer for my mom.
I ended up spending quite a while doing that until I finally found a good one and called my dad about it.
Shortly afterwards my dad came to my grandparents’ house and I helped him carry in groceries he bought for them.
Then I did some work on my computer for my dad.
I worked for a quite a while and then stopping for the day a little bit before dinner.
After I took a shower and ate dinner I hung out a bit more before getting ready to go.
As I was about to leave my grandma asked me about watching YouTube on their TV.
So I set up the chromecast that they had and connected it to the internet.
I wasn’t able to show her how to do it yet though, because they didn’t have the YouTube app downloaded yet.
After I got home I grabbed a package which had came for me in the mail.
It was the Christmad present I had gotten for my grandparents.
Once I wrapped it I did the dishes and got ready for bed.
Then I sat down outside to cut my nails.
Following that I came back and just hung out for the rest of the night.
I went to bed a bit late again, but I still have been getting all my sleep lately so it’s fine.
