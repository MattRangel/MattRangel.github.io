December 22, 2020 - Tuesday
My morning and afternoon today were pretty similar to the morning and afternoon I ghad yesterday.
I started off my morning just hanging out in my room.
Then once it got closer to noon I headed over to my grandparents’ house for the day.
I was going to watch a movie today, but I never ended up deciding on one.
For dinner my grandparents’ gave me some money to pick up some pizza and bread sticks.
Once I got back home I right away got started on the dishes.
Then I helped my dad wrap up some Colombian tamales.
After that I went back to my room amd hung out for a bit.
I didn’t brush my teeth, because I wanted to try a little of the tamales when they were done.
When I did brush my teeth I took a while, because I was getting distracted on my phone.
After that I should’ve gone to bed, but I ended up staying awake much longer.
