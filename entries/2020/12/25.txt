December 25, 2020 - Friday
After I woke up this morning I brushed my teeth and then woke up my brother.
Then I went to my parents’ room and woke up my mom.
Then three of us went to the dining room to open up our stockings.
I got bunches of candy which I sat and ate for a bit.
Next I woke up my dad so we could start opening the Christmas presents.
Once we my dad was out of bed and ready we got started.
I had sone coasters I bought for my mom and the ither things I bought didn’t come in time.
My gifts were some cool sleeve shirts and some other things.
After opening all gifts I watched the movie “State of Grace” (1990) with my mom.
We paused the movie in the middle to eat the lunch my dad made which was ravioli and shrimp.
Once my mom and I finished the movie I went to my room abd just hung out for a while until it was time to go to my grandparents’ house.
Over there my grandma had made some rosquitas for us to eat.
After eating we opened presents from my grandparents.
I got some more cool clothes as well as a bunch on money.
Getting back home my mom, dad, and I put on a movie to watch, but we all ended up stopped watching towards the end since it wasn’t the best movie.
After I shut off the movie I got ready for bed and then hung out in my room for the rest of the night.
My going to bed time for tonight was alright, but still kind of late for me.
