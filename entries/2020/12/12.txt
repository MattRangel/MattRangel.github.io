December 12, 2020 - Saturday
I woke up a little later than I normally do, because I went to sleep late last night.
While I was in the middle of my morning routine my dad called for my brother and I telling us that he needs help working outside.
So I finished the rest of my routine and then went outside.
He had me taking old stickers off lawn mower parts.
It was pretty cold outside, so I came back inside quickly to put on some warmer clothes.
Once I finished taking off all the stickers I put some Goo Gone on the areas to get rid of the sticker gunk.
Next I put on a couple new stickers on the freshly cleaned spots.
Followong that my dad and I cleaned up his shed a little bit.
After a bit I checked the time and realized I had to leave pretty soon to go hang out with my friends Ben and Darious.
When I came inside I changed my clothes and got ready to go.
Ben said to come later and Darious’ parents were taking him.
So I ended up having time to eat lunch before I left.
I had a can of SpaghettiOs and some ice cream.
At Ben’s house we played Roblox and hung out for a bit.
Then we went to Dollar General to get some snacks.
This time I chose to get caramel rice crackers.
Once we got back to Ben’s house we turned on the hot tub and played some basket ball wiile we waited for it to heat up.
It was still heating up when we were finished.
So we went back inside and cooked the frozen pizza we bought at Dollar General earlier.
By the time we finished eating pizza the hot tub had finished warming up.
Following the hot tub we all came back inside and ate some food that Ben’s mom brought.
Next we watched the movie “Us” (2019).
Once the movie was finished I took Darious home and then myself home.
Right after getting home I brushed my teeth and got ready for bed.
Despite the busy day I had I was able to go to bed earlier than last night.
Although I still did go to bed pretty late.
