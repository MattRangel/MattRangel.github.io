December 27, 2020 - Sunday
For my breakfast this morning I made myself some tea.
After I finished my tea I watched the movie “The Master of Disguise” (2002) with my brother.
It was a movie we watched as kids and so that’s why we watched it.
During the movie I also ate some snacks.
Following the movie with my brother I watched the movie “Blade Runner” (1982) with my mom.
During that movie my dad made us a lunch of an egg arepa.
After we watched that movie my mom and I watched the part two called “Blade Runner 2049” (2017).
While we watched that movie my dad made some chick, pasta, and vegetable soup for dinner which was also very good.
After that my mom and I took a little movie break.
My dad took me on a ride around the house on the ATV.
Once I came back inside I looked for and then pulled up the next movie called “The Banker” (2020).
I had some troubles pulling up the movie and almost quit trying, but I eventually got it to work.
During the first part of the movie I washed up all the dishes.
After the movie I got ready for bed and then hung out in my room for the rest of my night.
I didn’t stay up terribly late tonight aswell which is good.
