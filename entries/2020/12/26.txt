December 26, 2020 - Saturday
While I was going through my morning routine this morning I heated up a pot pie to have for breakfast.
But I got side tracked looking at what was causing my mom’s computer to run slow.
Then I helped my parents fill out a pdf file on the computer.
By the time I finished getting ready for the morning my pot pie was cool and it was more of a lunch than a breakfast.
After that I went back to my room coming out a little while later to watch a movie with my mom.
The movie was called “The Edge” (1997).
During the movie I ate some snacks which were candy, apple sauce, and some golden rasins.
Following the movie I went back to my room again until my dad called for me.
I thought he was going to ask me to help his work outside, but was happily surprised￼ that it was just to tell me we are all going out to eat.
On the way to the restaurant we filled up on gas and dropped off some tools my dad borrowed from the store.
We ate at restaurant called BJ’s and for my dinner I got deep dish ziti (pasta).
After I got back home I just hung out for the rest of the night.
I also played a tiny bit of Minecraft with my friend Kai.
My bed time for tonight wasn’t the best, but at the same time wasn’t too terrible.
