December 24, 2020 - Thursday
After waking up this morning I went through my morning routine and then got started working on the christmas tree.
There were sections of the lights that were out and so I had to find the problem bulbs and then replace them.
The bulbs that my dad bought were just the glass part and so I had to manually put them into the plastic casing.
At the very top of the tree all the bulbs of one section had burned out, so that one took especially￼ long.
After I got all the sections turned on I took a break to eat lunch.
For lunch I had some rice which my brother made and some of the tamales my dad made.
Following that I used up the rest of the spare bulbs to switch out some more burnt out lights.
Then I grabbed the decorations and hung them all up on the tree with my brother.
That took quite a while too because of all the ornaments we have.
After I finally finished working with the tree I went to my room.
Shortly after I laid down though my dad called me asking me to help him outside.
So for the rest of the afternoon￼ I was outside helping my dad work in the shed.
We came back inside to get ready to go to my grandparents’ house and then we all left.
At my grandparents’ house I had buñuelos which my grandma made, rice, and then another one of the tamales my dad made.
After that we said the novena and then listened to some christmas music.
Then we took a family photo and headed back home.
On the way home we stopped at Dollar General and got some ice cream sandwiches.
Once we got home I went to my room and hung out.
I played a game on my phone with a few friends for a while until it started to get late.
Then I got ready for bed, wrote up this entry, and then went to sleep.
