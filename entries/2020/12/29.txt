December 29, 2020 - Tuesday
I woke up a later than usual this morning, because of how late I went to bed last night.
After I got up I got ready for the day and then headed over to my grandparents’ house with my brother.
Once we got there I gave them the Christmas present I had bought for them.
It was a can of freeze dried miracle berries, which are a special berry that make sour things taste sweet.
Then I ate lunch and just hung out on my phone for a while.
Later on we all tried the miracle berries trying different foods.
After that I went back to hanging out and worked on something for my dad on my computer.
Then I took a shower and ate my dinner.
After dinner I taught my grandmother how to play YouTube videos on the TV.
I ended up sitting down and watching one of thoes videos where people will hand build structures in nature.
Once the video ended I headed back home.
Instead of getting my nightly tasks done right away after getting home I layed down in bed hung out.
Eventually I finally got up and washed the dishes and got ready for bed.
By the time I finished that it was already pretty late, and I ended up staying awake even later.
I’m going to want to start going to bed at my normal time soon, because I start school again in just a week.
