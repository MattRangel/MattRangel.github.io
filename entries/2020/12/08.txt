December 8, 2020 - Tuesday
Waking up this morning I remebered a dream for the second day in a row.
I’ve just started writing them down again so I’ll have better recall, but unlike the other times I’m making sure not to skip it.
Before leaving to the house I walked with my mom to my dad’s shed so that she could get his cup for him.
After dropping my brother off and getting to my grandparents’ house I pulled up all my school work for the day.
My school day was a but longer than average, but I was able to finish a bunch of school work ahead of time.
Right after finishing all my work I felt really exhaused.
So I ended up taking a nap for the rest of the afternoon.
I woke up to eat an orange, but I went right back to sleep afterwards.
My nap lasted all the way until it was time for me to take a shower and eat dinner.
After I ate I read my book “The Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett” and then headed home stopping for gas on the way.
Once I was home I got started on washibg the dishes.
Following the dishes I saw a text I got from my dad which had the address of the high school I’ll be going to in Florida.
Being able to actually see the school I’ll be going to made it feel at bit more real than it did before.
I spent a little bit of time looking at the school’s site and photos before going to brush my teeth.
While I brushed them I went and talked to my mom who played some music for me.
Next I went to my room and finished up getting read for bed.
I spent the last little bit of my time talking to friends and looking more at my soon to be new school.
Today was a successful go to bed on time day and hopefully I’ll be able to remeber some dreams when I wake up.
