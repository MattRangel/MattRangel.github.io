December 17, 2020 - Thursday
For my school day today all I really had to do was make sure to log into my classes.
So for the majority of the day I was just hanging out.
I finished watching the documentary I started yesterday, which was about some dudes hitch hiking across America.
There were no actual movies or TV shows I watched today.
I updated my phone and messed with it’s layout for a while.
Then I got on my computer and looked through old conversations I had with friends.
Before eating dinner my dad called me and ask for me to pick up some food from Panda Express for him.
So after I took a shower and ate that’s what I did.
I took my laptop bag home with me today, because I’m not going to be spending the day at my grandparents’ house.
Once I got home after picking up my dad’s food I got started on getting ready for bed.
I took a pause in the middle of that to make sure I had all the documents needed to renew my Colombian ID tomorrow.
After I finished getting ready for the night I had to set my alarm for very early tomorrow.
Then I just hung out in my room until it was time for me to go to bed.
I did procrastinate writing this entry tonight, but luckily I still went to bed on time.
