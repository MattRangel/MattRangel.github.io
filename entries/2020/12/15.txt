December 25, 2020 - Tuesday
My school day was pretty average today.
There wasn’t really anything for me to get ahead on, but I did have to do one assignment which I didn’t see at the end of last week.
I took a pause in my school day to eat lunch which was soup, chicken, and yellow rice all made by my grandma.
Following lunch and finishing my school day I scrolled through my phone for a bit looking through my movie to watch list for something I felt in the mood for.
I ended up picking the movie “Delicatessen” (1991).
After the movie I just hung out for the rest of the afternoon.
A little bit before going to take a shower and eat dinner I read my book “The Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett”.
For dinner I just had some ravioli.
Once I was done eating I went back to reading my book for a while until it got time for me to go back home.
Before leaving my grandparents’ house I showed the the photo my dad took of me in a suit for my Colombian ID photo which they really liked.
Getting home I made sure to get started on my nightly duties right away before hanging out any.
Firstly I had to wash the dishes.
Following that I went through my nightly routine of brushing my teeth, flossing, mouth wash, washing my face, and face lotion.
Then I went to my room and just hung out on my phone for the last little bit of the night.
I went to bed right on time tonight which is very good compared to the last two days, which I did not want to become a bad streak.
