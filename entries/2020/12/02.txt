December 2, 2020 - Wednesday
On my drive to drop my brother off at school and then go to my grandparents’ house I listened to my top 100 personal songs of the year.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house I got all my school work pulled up and then waited for school day to begin.
All my work was able to be finished up pretty quickly since I didn’t have too much left from working ahead the other day.
After school I watched the show “Neon Genesis Evangelion” (1995).
I was going to watch a movie with my grandparents, but by the time I actually found one it was kind of late to start a movie.
So I watched some more TV and ended up finishing the show.
I also watched some of the show “South Park” (1997) inbetween that.
After taking a shower and eating dinner I read some more of my book “The Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett”.
While I was getting ready to go I also downloaded the next few seasons of South Park.
Once I got home I washed the dishes and then got ready for bed.
I had a little bit of free time left before I had to go to bed.
So I watched some more of the movie “The End of Evangelion” (1997), which I had started watching after finishing the show earlier today.
