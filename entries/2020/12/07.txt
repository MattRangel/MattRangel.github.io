December 7, 2020 - Monday
I had an average length school day today and got a little bit ahead in some of my classes.
After school I was going to watch some TV, but I didn’t really have the attention for it.
Instead I spent most of the day chatting and scrolling through my phone.
I also watched some YouTube videos.
I read before I ate dinner today, because I was trying to get home earlier.
Getting home earlier than I normally do would give me time to read with my mom for a little bit at the end of the night.
Eating dinner took me a bit longer than normal, because I took a pause in the middle to research a coin my dad had just randomly bought.
It turns out it was a silver French coin from 1690.
I couldn’t figure out which one it was exactly based off the photo he sent me though.
After dinner I got distracted for a little bit before heading home.
Once I got home I looked closer at the coin and determined what is was down to two options.
It’s either a “France 1690-L 1/2 ecu” or a “France 1690-L ecu”.
I couldn’t tell for sure if it was a half ecu or not though.
My mom also called her friend who’s husband collects coins.
So I sent them the information I found so they could maybe tell us more.
Then I brushed my teeth and cleaned the dishes.
By the time I was done with all that it was a bit past my time to go to bed.
All the different distractions I had caused me the lose the extra time I tried to crave out earlier to read with my mom.
