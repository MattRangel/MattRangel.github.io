December 16, 2020 - Wednesday
In the morning while I waited for my school to start I looked for and then bought a christmas present for my grandparents.
My school day today was very brief.
After school
I didn’t really do too munch after school today either.
I mainly just watched YouTube and scrolled through my phonr chatting with friends.
There was a movie I started, but I paused it and decided to watch it with my mom later.
I started a documentary about a guy hitchhiking across america.
After eating dinner I didn’t read today, because I wanted to get home to watch the movie with my mom.
When I did get home she wasn’t there so I got started on getting ready for bed.
By the time I was finishing the dishes she got home, but it had gotten to be too late.
After that I went to my room and called with my grandparents to tell them tank you for the birthday card that they sent me.
Shortly afterwards I should’ve gone to bed, but instead I got distracted and ended up staying up pretty late.
I might take a nap tomorrow afternoon to make up for it.
