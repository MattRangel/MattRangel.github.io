December 1, 2020 - Tuesday
My morning started a little late this morning, because I slept past my alarm clock by a bit.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house I got started on my school work for the day.
All but one of my classes I was able to finish pretty quickly and then watched sone TV.
There was no work posted yet for my last class, so that’s why I had to take a break.
After lunch the work was posted and I got started.
My last class was graphic design and that took a while, because I have to use an alternative program for the assignments which I have to figure out on my own.
My dad asked if I wanted to go shopping for my grandparents with him, but I was still working so I wasn’t able to.
I did help him carry in groceries when he got back though.
After I finished school I watched TV on my phone for a bit more.
Then I took a shower and ate my dinner.
For dinner I had lasagna from the other day and some rice.
Following dinner I read my book “Pillars of the Earth” by “Ken Follett” for a little while before heading home.
Right when I got home I got started on the dishes and then got ready for bed.
Tonight I finished all my nightly things with a little extra time left over before having to go to bed.
Yesterday was a fluke I’m thinking and starting now again I’ll be going to bed on time.
