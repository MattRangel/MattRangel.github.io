December 4, 2020 - Friday
On my drive with my brother this morning I remembered to put on christmas music, but I ended up turning it off because there weren’t any good songs coming on.
My school day didn’t take too long, except for having to wait for my last class to post a test I had to take.
I got a 100% on the test and then I went to the auto shop, because my check engine light came on this morning.
They let me borrow their diagnostics machine to run on my car.
Normally they do it for me, but since corona virus I had to find where to plug in the machine and do it myself.
While I was finishing up my dad pulled up and checked the air filter.
It was clean, so he said to just not worry about the light.
After I got back to my grandparents’ house I watched the movie “WarGames” (19￼83) with then.
During the movie my mom called and asked me if I’d want to go to go Golden Corral tomorrow.
I told her I don’t really feel like eating there, abd so she ended up going with my brother today.
After that I didn’t really do too much besides scrolling through my phone and talking to friends here and there.
I was going to watch a TV show, but I never really got the energy.
Before I took my shower my dad called me to ask me to pick up some Panda Express food he’s ordering.
After my shower and dinner I normally read, but I didn’t today because I took too long eating.
So I headed right over to Panda Express to pick up my dad’s food.
Since it was timed to finish when I got there I did not have to wait very long at all.
Once I got home I got started on brushing my teeth.
While I was doing that my mom and brother got home.
I got distracted talking with each of them which made getting ready for bed take a little longer.
Once I did get finished I went to my room and just went back to hanging out since I didn’t really feel like watching a TV show or reading.
I went to sleep a little bit late tonight, but still alright I think.
