December 23, 2020 - Wednesday
I woke up to my mom calling me on the phone and my dad coming into my room at almost the exact same time this morning.
My dad told me that we were going to leave for Houston in a little bit to have lunch with an old friend of his named Francisco.
My mom was calling me to say the same thing.
So I got ready going through my morning routine and then getting dressed for the day.
After that I just waited around and helped my dad get things ready to go as we waited for my mom to get home so we could leave.
Once she got home we loaded up the car and left soon afterwards.
I did the whole drive there which took about three hours.
For the drive I chatted with my family a little bit, but most of my time was spent just listening to my music while I drove.
Once we got to Francisco’s house we cleaned up and then he and my dad set out the food.
Francisco had ordered some chinese food for us all to eat.
The chinese food was good and had a cool twist to it which made it a little different than average chinese food.
After we all finished eating everyone shifted outside to say hi to Francisco’s neighbor.
While they all chated I just listened and played with some of the dogs that were outside.
We didn’t say very long and left after they had all talked for a little while.
I made the whole drive back home too.
Splitting the drive into two parts we stopped for dessert at Cheese Cake Factory along the way.
Before going there today I had always thought it was an actual factory.
Once we finally got back home I made sure to waste no time and got started on getting ready for bed right away.
Then I washed the dishes and went to my room to hang out for the night.
I could’ve gone to bed earlier than I did, but I still went to bed a tiny bit better than I have been the past few days.
