December 14, 2020 - Monday
There were no dreams I remebered this morning for me to write down which I think is a result of me going to bed so late.
When I got to my grabdparents’ house I threw away the trash and then went inside to get started on my school day.
There was not a lot of work I had to do today, so I got ahead in some of my classes and finished for the day pretty quickly.
After I was done I texted my friend Sherry to see when she’d be done with school too, so we could play something on the computer.
She was done with school as well when I texted her so we got on the game Roblox and played until I had to go eat lunch.
For lunch I had potatoes, beef, rice, and vegetables.
Following lunch I played some more Roblox with Sherry until she had to get off.
After that I didn’t really do too much and ended up just scrolling through my phone until it was time for dinner.
My dinner was a ham and cheese arepa.
Then I read for a while before driving back home.
I read a little later tonight than I normally do, because my book was at an exciting part.
Once I got home I went and sat down in my room on my phone.
In hindsight if I would’ve not done that then I probably would’ve gone to bed at a better time.
But I didn’t and I eventually got up and went to wash the dishes.
While I washed them I watched a travel video about a guy who went to Afghanistan.
Next I started getting ready for bed, but I only got my teeth brushed before pausing to do something else.
My dad wanted to go see some schooting stars and so my mom, brother and I went outside with him too.
I saw two shooting stars while I was out there, but was pretty cold so it was a little uncomfy.
Once I came back inside I finished getting ready only getting distracted a few more times.
I ended up going to bed almost the same time as yesterday which isn’t good.
Tomorrow I’ll need to make sure not to start hanging out until I’m done getting ready for the night.
