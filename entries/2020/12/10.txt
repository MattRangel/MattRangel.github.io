December 10, 2020 - Thursday
Waking up this morning I didn’t right away remember any dreams to write in my journal, but while I was brushing my teeth I had some come back to me.
I didn’t really have a school day today since all I really had to do was check into a couple classes.
For the first part of mt morning I just scrolled through my phone and chatted with friends.
Then I got on my computer to look into starting a new web application project for fun.
Doing the research to figure out where I needed to start I slowly realized that it would be much more difficult than I initially thought.
So I turned off my computer and decided to just save the idea for another day.
After that I continued watching the movie “It’s Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books” (1988).
I finished the movie after I ate lunch and then I got on my computer.
On my laptop I fired up the game Roblox.
I saw my friend Darious was online, so I joined his game and talked with him for a bit.
Then I played by myself for a while.
After I got off I ate and orange and some grapes.
Then I just went back to hanging out on my phone until it was time to eat dinner.
For dinner I had a bowl of soup and a sandwich.
Next I went back to my room and read for a while before heading back to my house.
Once I got home I brushed my teeth and chatted with my mom for a while.
Then I went outside to cut my nails.
With my nails cut I stayed out for a bit more and wrote up this entry.
Following that I came back inside and spent the rest of my night just relaxing.
I went to bed right on time tonight which will hopefully make up for yesterday.
