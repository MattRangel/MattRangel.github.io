December 21, 2020 - Sunday
After waking up this morning I spent a while hanging out in my room before leaving to go do my morning routine.
I was looking into resetting my computer and reinstalling Windows and Linux.
While Windows was downloading I did my morning routine and the ate breakfast.
After Windows finished downloading I burned it to a disc.
Then I backed up a few files before installing windows.
While windows was installing my brother took me for a ride on the ATV.
Once I got back I finished setting up Windows and then installed and set up Linux.
After that I played Minecraft and Roblox for a little while with my friend Kai.
A little while after I got off my dad finished making dinner which was some salad, pork and rice.
I hung out in my room until my mom got back home.
Then I watched the movie “At Close Range” (1986) with her.
During the movie I ate a pretzle, some candies, and a bowl of cereal.
After the movie I washed the dishes which took a while.
My mom, brother, and I were going to go to the store after I finished, but my mom had to call with the bank so we weren’t able to go.
Next I started getting ready for bed, which took a really long time since I kept getting distracted talking with my mom.
After I finally finished I went to my room and procrastinated writing this entry for a bit before finally going to bed.
Tonight was another going to bed late night, but hopefully this isn’t turning into a bad streak.
