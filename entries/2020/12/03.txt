December 3, 2020 - Thursday
I was going to put on some christmas music while I drove my brother to school today, but I forgot to.
Once I got to my grandparents’ house I finished watching the movie “The End of Evangelion” (1997), which I had started earlier in the week.
After that I got started on my school work, but there wasn’t too much of it so I finished quickly.
There was a test in my history class today and I did good on that.
Afterwards I didn’t do too much for a while besides hang out on my phone.
I did figure out how to get subtitles on the movie watching program on my computer, so I was going to watch a movie with my grandparents but it was too late in the day again.
There was new show I started today called “FLCL” (2000).
My same friend who recommended the movie from this morning said that she likes thos show aswell.
After I ate dinner I read for a while like I normally do.
Once I got home I got started on brushing my teeth.
I went a little slower than normal for that part today￼.
Then I came to my room and stayed up until it was time for bed and then a little bit passed that.
