December 6, 2020 - Sunday
After waking up this morning I hung out in my bed for a bit before getting out of bed and starting my day.
I got up and my mom told me about cand in my shoe so I went and looked for it.
There was a pack of nerds jelly beans in one of my shoes.
Once I got my teeth brushed I cooked some pizza rolls for breakfast.
Next I ate up the candy I just got.
Then I went to my room and hung out until my mom was ready to watch a movie.
The movie I chose was called “Bad Company” (1972).
Right before the movie my mom, brother and I went outside to give my dad some water while he worked outside.
Before coming back inside he took us all on a ride on the ATV.
Then we came back inside and my mom and I watched the movie.
During the movie I ate some reheated rice and beans from the other day.
Following the movie I went back to my room and just hung out scrolling through my phone and talking with friends.
I took a couple breaks to eat the first one was some rice and second time was chicken wings my dad brought home.
After eating the second time I washed the dishes and then got ready for bed.
I read a part of my book for a while and then went back to hanging out on my phone.
My bed time tonight was good, but I did wait until last minute to write this.
Although it didn’t mess me up tonight it’s still a bad habit I don’t want to continue.
