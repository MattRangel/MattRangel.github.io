December 19, 2020 - Saturday
After waking up this morning I just hung out in my bed for a while before getting up out of bed.
My dad came into my room and asked me to move his car out of the grass for him, because it was raining.
Then I came back inside and brushed my teeth and washed my face.
Next I helped my dad make french toast for breakfast for my brother and I.
Along with my french toast I finished the rest of my syrup that my mom and dad had brought back for me from a trip a long time ago.
Following breakfast I went back to my room and hung out for a while.
I was on my phone for a bit and also played minecraft with a couple friends for a while.
While I was hanging out my dad called for me and asked me to make sone rice to go with lunch.
After my mom got back home I was going to watch a movie with her, but lunch had just been finished so we ate first.
For lunch my dad made pork, salad and beans, and we also had the rice I made of course.
The movie my mom and I watched after that was called “Coming to America” (1988).
Following the movie I went back to my room for a while.
I came out to get ready for bed and while I was doing that my dad asked me if I could set up the Christmas tree.
After I had it put up there were a few sections not on.
We have a troubleshooting gun thing that helps, but I couldn’t find it for a good whike until my mom did.
Then I got started on fixing the sections of lights.
While I was testing one of the sections all the lights of that section burnt out.
There were not too many spare bulbs, so I wasn’t able to finish fixing all the lights.
My dad is going to buy some new ones and then I will be able to though.
After I ran out of bulbs I finished getting ready for bed and went back to my room.
I ended up staying awake a bit later than I prefer to.
I am not going to be missing any sleep because of it, but I don’t want to start a bad sleeping streak over this winter break.
