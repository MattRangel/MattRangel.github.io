December 31, 2020 - Thursday
After I woke up I got ready to go to my grandparents’ house, but it turned out that wasn’t the plan for today my dad told me.
I played some Roblox this morning.
For breakfast I had some fruit that my grandma gave to me yesterday.
Later on my dad asked me to make some rice for lunch.
After the rice was done I ate some of it and also a tamale.
Then I just hung out in my room for the afternoon.
I drove with my dad to my grandparents’ house.
For dinner over there my dad cooked lamb and pork.
My grandma cooked yucca, rice, and black beans.
I just hung out on my phone for most of my time there waiting for new years.
I played a card game with my grandma, mom, and brother.
We all celebrated new years an hour earlier, so that way my grandparents wouldn’t have to stay up too late.
Once I got home I got ready for bed and talked with my brother while I did so.
By the time I finished brushing my teeth new years for our time zone was only several minutes away.
So my brother and I went and did the count down with my mom.
Afterwards I got on my computer and played minecraft with my friend Sherry for a while.
By the time we got off it was really late for me.
Then I stayed up even more going to bed at a pretty not so great time.
