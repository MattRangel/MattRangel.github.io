December 30, 2020 - Wednesday
I woke up a bit earlier than I have been lately, because of the really loud rain that started pouring.
After I got up and brushed my teeth I made myself a cup of tea for breakfast.
Then I was going to start watching a movie with my mom, but my dad told me that my grandparents were expecting me to come over for lunch since I didn’t say I wasn’t going to come over.
So I put a pause on the movie idea and went to my grandparents’ house to have lunch.
For lunch my grandma cooked shrimp, rice, and asparagus.
Afterwards I took my grandpa to the pharmacy to refill some medicine.
The drive through line was really long, so while we both waited I played some spanish music I had made a playlist of a while ago.
Once it was our turn in line we found out that neither of the bottles were ready to be refilled at that moment.
After we got back to their house I went back home with my brother.
There was a jam of traffic on the way home so my brother and I took the longer scenic route instead.
Once we got home I went back to my original plan from this morning and watched a movie with my mom.
The movie we watched was called “Papillon” (1973).
Following the movie my dad took my brother and I to get pizza.
On the way there we made a couple stops.
The pizza I got was BBQ sauce, mozzarella cheese, chicken, pineapple, and onions.
After we all got back home I changed into pajamas and then ate my pizza.
Next I washed the dishes and then got ready for bed.
I got a little distracted while getting ready for bed, because I sat down in my brother’s room and watch him play a game for a while.
After I finally finished getting ready for bed I went to my room and hung out.
I should’ve written this up right then, but instead I stayed up a bit too late kind of putting it off.
My going to bed time for tonight was a tad bit better than yesterday, but still not too great.
