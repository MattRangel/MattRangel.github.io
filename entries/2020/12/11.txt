December 11, 2020 - Friday
For my school day today all I had to do was take a quick test and finish a warmup.
After I quickly finished school I layed down and hung out on my phone for a bit.
Then I got on my computer and played some Roblox until it was time for lunch.
During and after lunch I watched the movie “Faust” (1994).
Following the movie I just hung out talking with friends some more and then I got back on Roblox.
I took a pause to go out with my dad and get ice cream.
Once I finished my ice cream I got back on my computer to play a bit more Roblox.
I ended up getting really into the game and played a little longer than I normally would, because I wanted to finish the game and if I got off I’d have to restart.
After my dinner had been waiting for me for a while I took a pause from the game, but let it keep running so I wouldn’t lose my place.
Following dinner I went right back to my game.
Once I had finally finished it I packed up my computer and headed home.
Normally I’d get ready for bed right after getting home, but tonight I messed up and layed down in my bed instead.
By the time I did get ready and go to bed it was kind of late, but I don’t have to wake up early tomorrow.
So I’m hoping I’ll still be able to sleep my normal amount.
