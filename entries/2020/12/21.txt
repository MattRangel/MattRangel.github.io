December 21, 2020 - Monday
I hung out in my bed for a while after waking up before getting up to start my day.
Once I was up I went through my morning routine anf the started collecting up my things to take to my grandparents’ house.
First I took the trash out to my trunk and then I came back inside to grab my regular stuff.
Once my brother and I got to my grandparents’ house it was a pretty regular day for me.
I mostly watched videos about technology for today.
There was a car part I was going to replace with my dad, but the check engine light has turned off so we decided to just wait.
When I got home I had a package delivered which was a present I ordered.
After checking it out I watched the movie “Elysium” (2013) with my mom.
Then I washed the dishes and got ready for bed.
I was watching more videos on YouTube while I did both of thoes, so I went kind of slow.
By the time I went to bed it was once again pretty late for me.
