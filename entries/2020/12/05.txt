December 5, 2020 - Saturday
Waking up this morning I didn’t get out of bed for a while and scrolled through my phone for a bit.
After I got up and brushed my teeth I made myself some breakfast.
My breakfast was a can of SpaghettiOs and some cut up hot dogs.
Then I went to my room and read for a while.
Later on my dad called me to watch some food on the stove.
While I did that I read some more.
My mom got home and I watched the movie “Equilibrium” (2002) with her.
During the movie I also made a pot of rice for my dad.
Half way through the movie it messed up, because a free trial I was using ended.
I went and bought half a year of another debrid service.
Following the movie I read even more until the dinner was ready.
For dinner we had beans, rice, and sausage.
Next we my parents, brother and I all watched the movie “American Me” (1992).
During the movie my mom made popcorn and my brother made cinnamon rolls.
After the movie I got ready for bed, but I didn’t go to bed for a while.
Once I did finally go to bed it was pretty late for the schedule I’ve been trying to follow.
