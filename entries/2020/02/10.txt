In the first half of my school day today nothing really happened out of the ordinary.
In english class the teacher had us writing a bunch which wasn’t the most fun.
At the beginning of math class I gave Jamie the CD mixtape thing that I made for her the other day.
Trying to get out of the parking lot in school took a pretty long while.
When my brother and I finally did get to my grandparents’ house I was pretty hungry.
After I ate I started watching “Criminal Minds” again which I haven’t watched in a pretty long time.
Once I got home I got distracted on my phone for a bit but then snapped out of it to get ready for bed and do thr dishes.
Following that I joked with my brother for just a little but dressing up in funny outfits.
That last thing put me going to bed a little past my personal set time, but it’s only by about 10 minutes which is no big deal.
