February 24, 2020 - Monday
This morning I almost forgot to turn in the note to my school office that says I’ll be absent tomorrow, but I remebered just in time.
In my first few morning classes I didn’t do all too much.
I was able to do tomorrow’s work today in my business class.
In my history class we got the papers for a project we are starting.
It doesn’t seem too hard just a lot of work to do.
I got out of school quick and easily.
At my grandparents’ house I just hung out on my phone and also ate like normal.
Once I got home I did the dishes which took a while.
After that a procrastinated getting ready for bed for a very long time.
I finally brushed them and was able to go to bed a little over an hour past the time I’d like to normally.
That’s pretty bad for a weekday, but I’m not too worried because I don’t have to wake up for school tomorrow.
I‘m not going to school tomorrow, because I’m going to be at my uncle’s wedding.
