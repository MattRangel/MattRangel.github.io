February 6, 2020 - Thursday
This morning I woke up to my back yard covered in snow.
Driving to school I didn’t have any complications because of the snow which was good.
When I got to school I sat outside and watched the people at school mess around in the snow.
I was by myself for a bit until my friend Charles came up to me.
During my 2nd, 3rd, and 4th periods I played on the computer some more (After I did my work of course haha!).
In math class I aked Jamie if she would want to hang out with me this weekend.
She replied that she’d have to see if she’s busy this weekend.
At my grandparents’ house I didn’t eat a whole lot, because I was already full from eating while full during my school lunch.
I couldn’t really get situated watching a YouTube video after school today.
So I spent the majority of my time watching the beginning of lots of diffrent videos and switching to different ones.
I’m going to bed a little bit after my preferred time, but still not too bad.
