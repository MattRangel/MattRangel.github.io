Februaey 9, 2020 - Sunday
I didn’t have to go to church today since my family and I all went yesterday.
So I was just at home for all of today.
I spent pretty much all of my morning plus a little of my afternoon finishing up looking through music to put on a playlist for Jamie.
When I finally finished it I gave it a full listen through.
I practiced hackysack for about half an hour while I was listening to it￼.
I’m pretty happy with how it turned out, and I’m very glad I was picky with what I chose to put on it.
After I finished going through the whole thing I took a shower because I was sweaty from practicing hacksack (it’s a sport alright haha).
Once I finished my shower I burned the music onto a CD.
I went and washed the dished after I was finished up with that.
Then I went on my walk with my mom and wrote what you’re reading right now after that￼.
I’m now going to bed about an hour later than I’d like, but that’s not too suprising.
