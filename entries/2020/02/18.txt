This morning in science class we were doing a circuits lab thing.
It was fun getting it to working like how I used to when I was younger.
After eating lunch my friends and I went outside to play hackysack like normal, but today it was actually a nice temperature outside.
In english class I had to write a paper but I got it done easily.
My teacher talked a whole bunch today in math class which made me pretty tired.
Getting out of the parking lot at school didn’t take too long today.
At my grandparents’ house I did the normal of eat and hang out on my phone.
I was able to get home at a good time tonight that let me do all my nightly things with half an hour to spare.
While washing the dishes and brushing my teeth I was watching a documentary about people who race shopping carts.
It’s a pretty cool/funny film so far.
