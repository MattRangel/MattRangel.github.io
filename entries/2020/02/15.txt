February 15, 2020 - Saturday
This morning my brother, mom, and I all went to eat breakfast at a mexican food place with my mom’s friend.
After finishing eating we headed back home.
At home I pulled up the movie “The Bridge on River Kwai”.
It was long movie so by the time it finished it was time to leave for church.
At church today I brought and read my “Tao Te Ching” book which made the time pass much faster.
When church finished we all went to walmart to get mouthwash and deodorant.
We also each got some ice cream pints.
Once we got home I made some rice and eggs for dinner for my mom and I.
For dessert I ate the ice cream I got at the store.
I wasn’t able to eat too much of it though, because my stomach started hurting.
It was pretty late by the time I finished eating and so I only had about ten minutes to hang out in my room.
Then I got all ready for bed and hit the hay on time.
