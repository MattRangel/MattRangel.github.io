February 16, 2020 - Sunday
This morning and a little bit of this afternoon was spent reading, playing on my computer, and eating.
At around 3pm I went to my friend Ben’s house to hang out with him and another friend of mine named Ryan.
Once it got dark we went and listened to music loud in each of our cars.
After listening to music for a bit we all headed to What-A-Burger in my car.
The food was kind of expensive, but it was fun hanging out.
I dropped them off back at Ben’s house and then headed home.
At home I hung out for a little while then my dad got home from being gone working for a while.
Since I was now up out of my room to say hi I also finished eating my left over What-A-Burger.
Then I brushed my teeth, wrote my daily entry right here, and took a shower.
I’m going to bed about half an hour late, but that’s still pretty good given that it’s the weekend and all.
