February 23, 2020 - Sunday
This morning when I woke up I got on my phone and procrastinated getting up for a bit.
Once I did get up and brushed my teeth I made a microwave pot pie and some tea for breakfast.
After breakfast I played on my computer for a while.
The rest of the day till church time was me hanging out in my room playing on my computer and watching youtube.
I did take a few breaks though to eat lunch and go on my walk with my mom.
After church my dad and I drove to some personâ€™s house so my dad could buy some boots.
Then we went to HEB and he got a few things while I filled the car with gas.
At home my dad made a dinner of eggs and rice for me.
Doing the dishes after dinner took a while.
And then I got ready for bed.
By the time I finished that and cleaning my room it was a little after the time I like to go to bed.
