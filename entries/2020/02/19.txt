February 19, 2020 - Wednesday
It was raining pretty much all day today.
At school I didn’t really do anything too hard.
I finished watching the documentary I had started yesterday this morning after I finished my work in first period.
I wasn’t able to play hackysack with my friends during lunch because it was still rainy and cold putside.
After school there was a car wreck on the way home so that made me get home a little late.
When I did get home my dad had a dinner ready.
He made some soup and also a sandwhich.
After lunch I went to my room and hung out a bit till it was time to get ready for bed.
While doing the dishes and brushing my teeth a started watching a new documentary about Neanderthals called “The Last Neanderthals”.
It’s pretty good so far and I’ll probably be able to finish it tomorrow.
I’m going to bed on time again tonight also.
