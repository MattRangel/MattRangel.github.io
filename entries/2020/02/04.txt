February 4, 2020 - Tuesday
I was able to go to the homeroom class that I wanted to today, because I didn’t have any work to catch up on.
So in homeroom I listened to music with Yamiel while I played Bust-A-Move on the computer.
I actually beat my personal best score today while playing.
I really like that game because it isn’t too complicated and doesn’t take a ton of brain power.
In math class I game Jamie back my iPod Shuffle again so that she can charge it, because the charger I’ve got is broken.
During history I got to use my fountain pen to take today’s notes.
I decided to put it in my bag because I wanted to try and use it more often.
At my grandparents’ house I was going to go outside and skateboard, but I changed my mind and practiced drawing instead.
I drew a hat, a house, Scatman John (He’s a singer), and my friend Ryan.
I want to get back into drawing/sketching, but I always forget to practice.
I thought that the wedding I’m going to was tomorrow, but as it turns out it isn’t for another few weeks.
That was a good suprise, because I didn’t really want to miss school tomorrow.
At home tonight I got all my things for the night done in time for me to be able to go to bed on time.
