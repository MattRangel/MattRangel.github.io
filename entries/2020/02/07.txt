February 7, 2020 - Friday
In my first few classes today there was nothing really assigned to do.
So I didn’t do too much productive stuff.
I didn’t eat very much during lunch again.
I’m not sure what’s been making me feel not so hungry lately.
In english class it was just a reading day, so I got to read my own book which was nice.
In math class I asked Jamie if she was going to be able to hang out on the weekend.
She said she couldn’t because her parents aren’t home.
She also gave me back my CD that I let her borrow a few days ago.
I don’t think she super liked it, which isn’t a big deal because I wasn’t really for sure if she would.
In history class I got a 100 on the test I took which I was suprised about, because I thought I got at least a few questions wrong.
My brother left school with a friend so I was able to leave school quickly today since I didn’t have to wait for him.
I still wasn’t too hungry when I got home.
So I spent a while looking through music and then ate around 8pm or so.
After I ate my dinner my mom and dad got into the car with me and we all drove to Sonic.
I got an icecream cone and a cherry slush.
When I got back home I procrastinated￼ brushing my teeth and just went on my phone some more.
I did get up to brush my teeth eventually, and now I’m going to bed very late.
