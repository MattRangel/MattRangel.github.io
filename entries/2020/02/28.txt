The first half of my dad at school was pretty chill and I didn’t really do anything.
The second half was pretty much the ame as well.
After school I went to eat at my grandparents’house, because my mom was brining my other grandparents to come eat there.
Once we finished hanging out for a bit after eating we all left.
I went straight home, my dad went to the store, and my mom dropped my brother off at a friend’s house.
At home I ate some apple pie that my dad brought home from the store then went to my room.
In my room I worker on setting up my computer to dual boot Windows 10 and Linux Mint.
After I got that to work I went on my walk with my mom and also my grandpa who joined us.
My grandma also joined us on our way back from the walk.
I put on a movie for my grandparents and then went back to my room to work with my computer.
I got sucked into what I was doing so I didn’t get to bed till a couple hours after I would’ve liked.
