This morning I played games on my computer for a bit.
Then my uncle and aunt came over and they go in the car with me, my mom, and my grandparents.
We all drove to go pick my brother up.
After we picked my brother up we drove around to various thirft stores.
While we were waiting for my aunt and grandma to shop around my mom and I went to this odd gambling place that was actually technically a sweepstakes.
My mom actually ended up walking away with seven dollars that she earned playing with the free points that she got.
We also went to a book store where I bought two CDs of albums that seemed cool.
Once we were done shopping we went to eat at Golden Corral.
When I finally got home I went back to my room and played on my computer for a bit more.
Untill my dad called for me to come eat the food he made which was very good.
After I ate dinner I went back to my room and procrastinated going to bed for a pretty long time.
I'm hoping that I wont be too tired when I have to wake up early for school on Monday.
