Today was a very very cold day.
In my first few classes today I didn’t really do anything except go on my phone or play on the computer.
During lunch I wasn’t very hungry at all so I barley ate anything.
In math class Jamie gave me back my iPod which she said wouldn’t charge when she tried it.
After school at home my dad had dinner ready which was soup and rice.
When I finished eating I was going to watch a movie in my room, but I couldn’t get the movie to work.
So instead I just listened to music and also looked for a bit of new music.
I think I listened to a bit too much sad music though, because for the rest of the night I had a sort of down feeling.
I am going to bed on time though so that does make me happy.
