I was way less tired than I thought I was going to be today since I went to bed really late last night.
I’m actually enjoying what we are doing in my science class right now so it’s a good way to start off the day.
After lunch while my friends and I were outside playing hackysack we actually did pretty good.
I can see us all improving from when we first started playing a while ago.
In my english class we worked on poems which was eh.
In math we worked on a test review which wasn’t too hard so it was actually a tiny bit fun kind of like a puzzle.
History class we looked at the project posters the other groups made and wrote about them on a paper.
In my graphic design class I finally started getting caught up on the work I missed the past few days.
Getting out of the parking lot went pretty quickly thankfully.
At my grandparents’ house I watched YouTube and ate.
Once I got home I brushed my teeth and got ready for bed.
I actually had time to spare today since my grandparents did my dishes for me. (Thank you!! - Whenever/if you read this haha)
