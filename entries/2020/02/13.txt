When I got to school in the morning instead of immediately walking to school I waited in my car for a bit and then walked with my friend Yamiel.
During my science class we had to write a paper which turned out to be much easier than I first thought.
After lunch my friends and I played hackysack very briefly.
In english class my class finished watching the movie that we’ve been watching.
When I got to math class I talked with Jamie and she said that this Monday she is free to hang out.
I’m pretty happy, but I don’t think I’ll actually feel like it’s real until I’m actually driving over there that day.
That’s just because of stuff that’s happened with me before with things getting a set day but then not actually happening.
Not sure if that makes sense but that’s that haha.
Anyway, in history class there was another paper that I thought would take a long time, but ended up being real easy.
After school my brother and I did our new strategy of me getting in the car line without him.
That let us get to our grandparents’ house pretty past.
Once I finished eating the lunch my grandma made I looked through music for new things.
I got home and ready for bed with time to do my walk with my mom.
Going to bed ontime while also getting all my other nightly things done feels good.
