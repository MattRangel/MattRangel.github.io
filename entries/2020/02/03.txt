February 3, 2020 - Monday
I woke up well rested this morning so that means that I didn’t get too messed up from my lack of sleep this weekend.
I wasn’t able to go to my computer class for homeroom today because I had to take a quiz I missed last week.
It was sprinkling￼ a little bit outside during lunch but my friends and I still went outside to play hackysack.
During my math class Jamie gave me back my iPod shuffle which she was not able to fix.
I gave her my “Clementine￼ Was Right” CD to borrow because I though that she might enojy it.
My skateboard was in my trunk so I could practice after school at my grandparents’ house, but it was still raining some when I got over there.
When I got home I tried to fix my iPod myself using an idea I got from watching another guy fix my problem on YouTube.
I was actually able to fix it which I even didn’t fully expect to happen.
I’m going to bed about half an hour late tonight, but that’s still in what I’d call my “good” range.
