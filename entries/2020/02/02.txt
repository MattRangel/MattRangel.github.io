February 2, 2020 - Sunday
This morning my sister and I woke up bright and early to head out to the airport.
We ate the breakfast at the hotel but it wasn’t that much so we stopped at McDonald’s.
By the time I finished eating the McChicken I got we were at the airport.
We went to the wrong building at first so we had to hurry over to the correct one.
Once we got into the actual building it went fine and I got to the gate with 10 minute s￼or so to spare.
On the plane I made friends with the guy who sat next to me.
So I spent the majority of my time either reading, listening to music, or talking.
After the plane finally landed I had to wait a few hours for my mom to come pick me up.
I wasn’t too bothered abouy having to wait though, because I was just watching YouTube on my phone while I waited for her.
We drove to a pizza place on our way home for dinner which was pretty good.
The pizza I got had pineapple, ham, sausage, bacon, and hot sauce on it.
Once we finished dinner I drove the rest of the way home for my mom.
The car didn’t have an aux cord though so I just listened to the “Clementine Was Right”￼￼ CD I bought a few days ago.
After getting home I went on my skateboard for a few minutes and then came back inside.
I then brushed my teeth, cleaned my room, and packed my school bag back with my school things.
While and then a little bit after I did thoes things I watched the movie “Gran Torino”.
The movie was really good and I give it a good 9/10.
I’m not going to bed right on time, but it’s definitally an improvement compared to the last few days.
