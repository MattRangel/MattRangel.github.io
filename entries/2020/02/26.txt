February 26, 2020 - Wednesday
Today was a very long day for me.
My mom took my brother and I to school this morning, because my mom was picking me up from school later in the day.
My friends and I went outside to play hackysack after lunch and it was windy and very cold.
In my history class my group and I pretty much finished our project due tomorrow which is cool.
In all my other classes I was able to easily catch up on the work I missed.
My mom signed me out of school about half an hour early.
I then drove us to San Antonio where our concert was at.
We didn’t have a whole bunch of time to spare on our way there, so we got gas station food instead of stopping at a restaurant.
Once we finally got to the theater we parked in a garage and then went inside.
The show was very good and the people who opened (“Deep Sea Diver”) for “Joseph” and “Joseph” themselves both performed verry well.
After the show my mom and I walked to a nearby Ihop.
At the Ihop I got a milk shake which was good and then a pancake thing which was not as good.
Then we went to the car and started our drive home.
On the drive home I started to get tired so my mom drove the middle part of thr drive and then I finished off the last 30 minutes.
Finally at home I brushed my teeth and got ready for bed.
I got to bed at 2:30 am which is nowhere near my daily goal, but that was expected for today haha.
