Note: I forgot to write this entry the night of, so I’m writing it Sunday afternoon.
My sister and I got to california today after driving for a long long time.
After checking into the hotel we went to the Santa Monica pier and walked around some looking at all the things.
We did two of the rides at the amusement park.
Once we were done doing rides we walked over to a place to eat dinner.
For my dinner I ate some tomatoe soup, because I was not super hungry.
Then we got some rental scooters and drove to an ice cream place.
The ice cream I got was strawberry with coconut milk and then a scoop of vanilla on top of that.
We didn’t want to to drive the scooters all the way to the car so we got a Lyft car to come pick us up.
The Lyft car was a Tesla which was cool.
On the hour drive back to the hotel I fell asleep.
I didn’t to bed until around 12am which is 2am in Texas time.
So I was real tired by that time.
I hope to be able to get back on my sleep schedule easily despite the bad sleep I got the past few days.
