February 17, 2020 - Monday
I didn’t have school today because of Presidents’ Day.
I woke up a little tired at first this morning, because I went to bed an hour late last night.
By the time I finished brushing my teeth I was fine though.
I just hung out in my room for the morning till around 11am when me and my brother left to go to my grandparents’ house for lunch.
I just hung out on my phone some more after I finished eating.
After a bit I drove my brother to a friend’s house.
I got my gas filled up on the way back to my grandparents’ house.
By the time I drove my brother back to my grandparents’ house for dinner it was kind of late.
That combined with the dishes I had to do at home made me go to bed about half an hour late.
