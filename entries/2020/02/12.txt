February 12, 2020 - Wednesday
It was raining on and off when I woke up this morning, but by the time I got to school it was pretty much done raining for the day.
My friends and I dodn’t play any hackysack today, because it was still wet outside from the rain.
I finished the book I’ve been reading in english class which is nice, because that wasn’t my most favorite￼ book.￼
After school I got in the line of cars before waiting for my brother today which let us get out of the parking lot much quicker than we normal do.
At home my mom had a kind of burnt grilled cheese sandwhich that she let me eat.
That wasn’t enough food so I also ate a bowl of Spaghetti O’s mixed with chopped up hotdogs.￼
While I was finishing eating that I put on the movie “The Irishman” (2019) to watch with my mom.
It was a really long movie so by the time it was done it was already time for me to get ready for bed.
I still went on my walk with my mom after getting ready though, but that did get me going to bed a little late.
