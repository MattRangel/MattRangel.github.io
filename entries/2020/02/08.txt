February 8, 2020 - Saturday
I did not sleep too much last night, because my brain decided to wake up real early.
I looked through music basically all day today until it was time to go to church.
I did take a break at one point though to eat some SpaghettiOs type thing.
After church my mom, dad, and I went to HEB to get some snacks.
At home my mom put a movie on which I had already seen, but I watched it anyway.
Once the movie finished up I brushed my teeth and then went to bed.
I’m going to bed at a little bit of a better time than yesterday, but still not to great of a time.￼
