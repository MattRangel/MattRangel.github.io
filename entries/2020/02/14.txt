February 14, 2020 - Friday
I had to scrape the frost off my window before leaving for school this morning.
During the first half of my school day I didn’t really do anything too difficult.
In english class I just read my book like I do every friday.
I chatted with Jamie some in math class and we listened to music with another friend of mine.
My last two classes were pretty chill and were a good way to end my school day.
Jamie texted me the link to a playlist of songs that she listens to.
Getting out of school went pretty quickly.
Once I got home I ate some cereal and marshmellows that my mom bought.
After I went to my room I worked on converting Jamie’s YouTube playlist to an Apple Music playlist.
By the time I was finishing that up my mom’s friend plus her friend’s family came over to spend the night.
I stood out in the living room and listened to them talk for a bit till it got to my time for bed.
I went and brushed my teeth and then wrote this entry.
I also started the process of listening through all the songs in Jamie’s playlist while writing tonight.
I’m now going to bed pretty close to the time I like to, which is very good since I don’t usually on the weekend.
