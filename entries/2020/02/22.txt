February 22, 2020 - Saturday
This morning when I woke up I layed in bed on my phone for about an hour before getting up do brush my teeth and stuff.
After brushing my teeth I ate my breakfast.
Following breakfast I hung out in my room and played on my computer for a bit.
Later on I went outside to practice skateboarding.
I do feel like I made some improvements from practicing today.
I then came back inside and hung out in my room some more.
Once it got to be dinner time all my family and I all got in the car and drove to a Korean food place.
I liked the seafood and noodles soup that I chose to order.
It was quite a lot of soup, but I finished the whole bowl.
On the way home from dinner we stopped at the store to get some ice cream.
I didn’t go inside though, because I didn’t want any ice cream.
When they got back to the car they had Hi-Chews (a type of candy) that they bought for me which was cool because I was just thinking about thoes. 
At home I wasted no time and got ready for bed.
I was able to go to bed at a pretty good time.
