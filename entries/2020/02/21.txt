Today kept feeling like thursday, because of the day off I had on Monday.
My friends and I were able to play some hackysack after finishing lunch today since it wasn’t too wet.
In english class I got to read my book some more.
Then in math class I again asked Jamie if she wanted to hang out this weekend.
I didn’t have it planned to ask her I just kind of thought it up in the moment.
I’m not too sure it’s going to actually happen though, but it’ll be all right.
Getting out of school didn’t take too long.
Once I got home I ate some leftover gumbo from like a week ago.
After eating I went to my room and played on my computer for a bit.
Then I got on my phone for the rest of the night.
I took a couple breaks to go on my walk with my mom and another to eat the wings my dad bought for dinner.
I procrastinated getting ready for bed for a pretty long time so I going to bed late tonight.
Hopefully I won’t feel too exhausted in the morning tomorrow.
