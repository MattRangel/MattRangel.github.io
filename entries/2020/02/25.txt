February 25, 2020 - Tuesday
I woke up early even though I went to bed late and didn’t even have to wake up early.
With the extra time I had before I went to the wedding I hung out in my room for a while playing on my computer and phone.
On the two hour ride to the wedding I watched youtube, talked with my mom, and also listened to her music for a bit.
The wedding plus the dinner reception after took about till about 10 or 11pm.
And then I didn’t get to bed till a little after 1am.
I’ve got another busy day tomorrow with the concert I’m going to with my mom.
So I’m going to be pretty tired by the time Thursday comes.
