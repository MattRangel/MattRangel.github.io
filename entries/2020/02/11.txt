February 11, 2020 - Tuesday
It was pretty rainy and dreary￼ outside all day today.
I woke up feeling a little tired but that passed after a few minutes.
At school I didn’t do too much in the first half again.
After eating lunch my friends and I still went outside to play hackysack for a little bit even though it was very cold.
In my english class I got into “the zone” and actually did the assigned reading.
I tried to use my fountain pen to do my warmup in history class, but it seems that loose notebook paper is too thin and the ink bleeds through to the other side.
Trying to leave schoool took a long time.
When I finally did get to my grandparent’s house I watched some more “Criminal Minds” on my phone after I ate.
I’m going to bed exactly on time tonight.
Hopefully that will help me not feel as tired during the day.
