In my computer class today one of my previous teachers visited, and he talked about what he does now.
In english class and in history class I took benchmark tests.
They were not that difficult, but did take a little bit.
In history tomorrow we are still working on the test so that means that I’ll get to go on my phone during that time.
In graphic design class I finished the project I’ve been working on in there and also played uno on my phone with a few of my friends for a while.
At my grandparents’ house I chilled on my phone watching YouTube and TikTok videos.
I got home home with about 40 minutes to get ready for bed which is plenty.
I finished getting ready for bed on time and was able to go to bed at a good hour.
