Going to bed at a good time tonight, so hopefully this is a start to a long streak of days where I go to bed on time.
This morning my car’s “check engine soon” light came on when I started up the car.
After school I went to the auto shop place so they could plug their computer thing into it.
The little device said there was four different things wrong.
My dad is going to look at it when he gets back from his trip to florida.
