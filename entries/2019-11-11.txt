Had the day off from school today because it’s Veteran’s Day.
So all I really did was play games on my laptop and eat.
I did talk with my grandmother more than I usually do today though.
She told me that my grand father almost had to go fight in the vietnam war, but he ended up not having to because he was away doing a different task for the military during the time when they were getting people.
