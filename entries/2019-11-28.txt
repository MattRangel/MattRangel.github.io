Todays was apretty simple thanksgiving but the food my dad and grandmother made were both still very good.
After eating at my grandparents’ my family and I all drove to the roundrock mall which is about a fourty minute drive.
Getting there we realized that the mall didn’t open for another hour and a half.
So we sat in the car and waited for them to open.
Getting in we only really bought stuff from two places which were the polo store and a fudge shop.
