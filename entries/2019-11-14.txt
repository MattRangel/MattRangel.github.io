Going to bed late tonight again because I watched another night time movie.
The movie was Trainspotting (1996) and it was pretty good.
I’m no movie reviewer or other wise I’d give a more in depth opinion on the movie than just “it’s pretty good” haha.
Lots of people were playing hacky sack today and it was about to get out of control but the bell rang for us to go to class so nothing too crazy happened.
